# Task

**Explore Healia's Services and Impact**

As a potential client interested in employee health benefits,
I understand Healia's offerings and how they make an impact,
so that I can make an informed decision about potentially partnering with Healia to enhance our employee health benefits.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Healia Health website
When I click on the 'What Healia Does' button, then click on 'Healia's Impact' and finally 'Stress Free Savings'
Then I should see detailed information about Healia's services, their impact on cost savings, recruitment, retention, and employee education.
