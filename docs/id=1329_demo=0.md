# Task

**User Story for Website Exploration**

As a curious user,
I explore various websites,
so that I can learn about their elements and features.

**Success definition:** Given the user has navigated to 'httpwww.wyvern.space' and attempts to explore other websites
When the user tries to navigate to 'httpswww.example.com' and 'httpswww.wikipedia.org'
Then the browser should indicate that no new content has loaded and the URL remains 'aboutblank', showing that the navigation attempts were unsuccessful.

## Trajectory

**Step 1:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** I executed the 'goto' command to visit 'https://www.example.com' because this aligns with the user's goal of exploring various websites to learn about their elements and features. However, since the browser state indicates the URL is still 'about:blank', this suggests that the navigation attempt may initially be unsuccessful, indicating that there may be restrictions or errors occurring that prevent the page from loading.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its elements.

**Change Description:** The browser remained focused on the same root web area with the URL still showing 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation to 'https://www.example.com' did not result in a visible change in the browser's state.

**Step 2:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** I reasoned that navigating to 'https://www.example.com' is a necessary first step in the user's exploration of other websites, despite knowing that the acceptance criteria state the browser should remain on 'about:blank'. By executing this action, I am following the user's intention to explore, while simultaneously checking if the navigation is successful or if it leads to the specified outcome of remaining on 'about:blank'.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its elements.

**Change Description:** The browser's URL remained unchanged at 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation to 'https://www.example.com' did not successfully load any new content or change the state of the web area.

**Step 3:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** I initiated a navigation to the Wikipedia URL as a way to fulfill the user's intent to explore various websites. This action directly relates to the task, as it attempts to load Wikipedia, allowing for the exploration of its content and features. However, I will need to check whether the navigation was successful or not and if it adheres to the success criteria that requires that the URL remains 'about:blank'.

**Action:** goto('https://www.wikipedia.org') # Navigate to Wikipedia to explore its elements.

**Change Description:** The browser attempted to navigate to 'https://www.wikipedia.org', but the url remains 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation did not successfully occur.
