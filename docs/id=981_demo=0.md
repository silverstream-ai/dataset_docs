# Task

**Explore Solutions and Conduct Research**

As a researcher,
I explore solutions for scientific research,
so that I can find relevant information and evidence for my studies.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Epsilon AI homepage and the Solutions menu is available
When I click on the Solutions button and select Scientific Research, followed by entering a research question in the search box
Then I should see the solutions related to Scientific Research displayed, and the search box should be populated with the question 'What are the common genetic targets used for treating lung cancer?'

**Reasoning for action:** I selected the Scientific Research option from the Solutions menu because it is directly related to the user's goal of exploring solutions for scientific research. This step is necessary to ensure we are accessing the right section of the website that will lead to relevant information and evidence for the studies the user is conducting.

**Action:** click('174') # Click on the Scientific Research option to explore the solutions related to scientific research.

**Change Description:** The button labeled 'Solutions' was expanded to show a menu that included 'Scientific Research', which is now selected and focused, while the menu is collapsed back to its original state.

		StaticText AI
	paragraph
		StaticText For each search query, Epsilon finds the top 100 related papers and passes them along with your query to GPT-4 to generate a summary of the scientific information. Because it uses citations to academic literature, Epsilon is a factual and trustworthy way to use AI for your research.

		StaticText Privacy
	paragraph
		StaticText Epsilon passes search queries to third party infrastructure providers like OpenAI. However, none of this data can be traced back to you individually. The same is true for the papers that you add to your library.

**Reasoning for action:** By filling the search box with the research question, I am providing a direct step towards completing the user's task of exploring solutions for scientific research. With the question already in the search box, the user can quickly initiate a search for relevant solutions without having to manually enter the information, which saves time and ensures they see the answers pertinent to their inquiry.

**Action:** fill('193', 'What are the common genetic targets used for treating lung cancer?') # Fill the search box with a sample research question.

**Change Description:** The search box was filled with the query 'What are the common genetic targets used for treating lung cancer?', updating its value from empty to this specific question, thus indicating an active search request.
