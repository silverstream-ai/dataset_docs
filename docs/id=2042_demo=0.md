# Task

**User Journey Through Inversion Space Website**

As a curious visitor to Inversion Space's website,,
I explore the details of the Ray capsule and learn about the company and its news updates,,
so that I can gain a comprehensive understanding of the companys offerings and stay informed about their latest activities.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Inversion Space homepage
When I navigate to the RAY section and then to the COMPANY and NEWS sections
Then I should see detailed information about the Ray capsule, the company's background, and the latest news articles without any errors.

		StaticText WHAT WE DO
		StaticText We build autonomous re-entry vehicles to deliver cargo from space.
		StaticText The advent of aircraft enabled the sky to be utilized for transportation. Inversion seeks to achieve the same breakthrough for space. Historically, countries and groups that have embraced step changes in transportation capabilities have been able to set the rules, construct on their foundations, and prosper as a result. We aim to ensure the US leads the way in this new modality, mirroring its pioneering role with the advent of aircraft.

We distinguish ourselves from traditional space companies. All our customers reside on the ground, and it is here that our vehicle ultimately delivers its value. Since we cater to customers on the ground, we expect our impact on the world to rapidly expand as we tap into pre-existing markets.

**Reasoning for action:** I began by clicking on the RAY link because it is the first step in fulfilling the user story. This action directly takes me to the relevant section of the website where I can find comprehensive details about the Ray capsule. Accessing this section is crucial, as it aligns with the user's intention to learn more about the company's offerings.

**Action:** click(65) # Click on the RAY link in the navigation menu to explore that section.

**Change Description:** The browser's state changed from displaying the homepage of Inversion Space to the 'Ray' section, as indicated by the updated URL 'https://www.inversionspace.com/ray', a new heading 'Ray Capsule', and various relevant static texts and images describing the Ray capsule and its purpose.

		StaticText OUR STORY
		StaticText Inversion was born in our garage in Los Angeles in 2021, when we realized that by creating low-cost re-entry vehicles, we could unlock brand new markets and harness the peculiarity of space. We took Inversion through Y Combinator in the summer of 2021, resulting in funding from amazing partners that enabled the rapid scaling up of the team and facilities. We are incredibly proud of the team, with each member demonstrating not only excellence in their technical domain, but also a "founder mentality" that is critical to Inversion's progress and future. We are building Inversion not because we love space, but because we believe that the advancement of humanity occurs when decades of technical improvements are uniquely packaged with a clear vision of the future. For Inversion, that means making space a transportation layer for Earth.

		StaticText OUR STORY
		StaticText Inversion was born in our garage in Los Angeles in 2021, when we realized that by creating low-cost re-entry vehicles, we could unlock brand new markets and harness the peculiarity of space. We took Inversion through Y Combinator in the summer of 2021, resulting in funding from amazing partners that enabled the rapid scaling up of the team and facilities. We are incredibly proud of the team, with each member demonstrating not only excellence in their technical domain, but also a "founder mentality" that is critical to Inversion's progress and future. We are building Inversion not because we love space, but because we believe that the advancement of humanity occurs when decades of technical improvements are uniquely packaged with a clear vision of the future. For Inversion, that means making space a transportation layer for Earth.
