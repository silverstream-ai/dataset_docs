# Task

**User Story for Web Navigation**

As a casual internet user,
I explore and access information from different websites,
so that I can learn and gather information from various sources.

**Success definition:** Given I am a casual internet user intending to explore online content
When I attempt to navigate to 'httpswww.example.com' and then to 'httpswww.wikipedia.org'
Then the system should not successfully load either website, indicating a potential issue with the navigation.

## Trajectory

**Step 1:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** I initiated navigation to 'https://www.example.com' because this is the first step in the user's task of exploring online content. The goal is to determine if this particular website can be accessed successfully. Whether or not the website loads will help evaluate the system's performance in this context and check if there is indeed a navigation issue, as anticipated in the user story.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser was intended to navigate to 'https://www.example.com', but it appears that the navigation did not occur as the URL remains 'about:blank' and the focus is still on the RootWebArea.

**Step 2:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** I initiated navigation to 'https://www.example.com' to fulfill the user story of exploring online content. The user intends to access different websites for information, so it is essential to try loading the first website as part of the task. However, according to the acceptance test, I expect the system not to successfully load this website, which will help in verifying the stated issue with navigation.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser attempted to navigate to 'https://www.example.com', but the URL did not change from 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation did not succeed.

**Step 3:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** Since the user story indicates an intent to explore different websites including Wikipedia, going directly to 'https://www.wikipedia.org' is a logical action to fulfill that objective. However, based on the task's success criteria, I am aware that this navigation is expected to fail, showing a potential issue with loading the site, which is consistent with the goal of exploring navigation problems.

**Action:** goto('https://www.wikipedia.org') # Navigate to Wikipedia to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser attempted to navigate to the Wikipedia website, but the URL remained unchanged as 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation did not result in a successful page load.
