# Task

**Demo Request Process Completion**

As a potential client,
I request a demo of the Seer platform,
so that I can evaluate its features and see how it can enhance my luxury sales process.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Seer website's demo request page
When I fill in all required fields correctly and submit the form
Then I should receive a success message indicating my request has been received and the form fields should be cleared.

**Reasoning for action:** I filled in the required fields with appropriate information (First Name, Last Name, Company Name, and Email) as the demo request form necessitates these to be filled correctly before submission. Each `fill()` action populates one of the input fields with valid sample data, which is critical in advancing towards the goal of requesting a demo. After filling out these fields, I executed the `click(87)` action on the Submit button to send the request. This action is essential to trigger the submission process, leading to the success message that confirms the demo request has been received.

**Action:** fill(83, 'John') # Fill in the First Name field
fill(84, 'Doe') # Fill in the Last Name field
fill(85, 'Example Company') # Fill in the Company Name field
fill(86, 'john.doe@example.com') # Fill in the Email field
click(87) # Click on the 'SUBMIT' button to submit the form.

**Change Description:** The form fields for First Name, Last Name, Company Name, and Email have been populated with the values 'John', 'Doe', 'Example Company', and 'john.doe@example.com' respectively, but upon clicking the 'SUBMIT' button, an alert indicating 'Please fill out this field.' appeared, suggesting that one or more required fields were still incomplete.

	StaticText As a top-grossing stylist, Christina Czap, our cofounder, spent countless hours tracking down quality images, texting detailed recommendations, and advising her discerning clients. Customized look-books, created with solutions like Photoshop and Keynote, proved critical to her success but consumed her nights, weekends and even vacations. She knew there had to be a better way. We like to say that Seer, born out of Christina’s own pain points, was 15 years in the making.

	StaticText We know your teams don’t have time to tinker with new programs or click back and forth between multiple windows. We’ve made Seer as intuitive for the associate as it is elegant for the customer.

**Reasoning for action:** I filled in the First Name field to ensure it contains the required information as specified, which is crucial for completing the demo request form successfully. Since the form requires this field, filling it again prevents any potential validation issues during submission.

**Action:** fill(83, 'John') # Fill in the First Name field again
click(87) # Click on the 'SUBMIT' button to submit the form again.

**Change Description:** The form submission was successfully executed, resulting in a new success message displayed that acknowledges the receipt of the user's submission. The focus shifted to a success region, indicating that the form was completed and the previous input fields were cleared, while feedback was given to the user.
