# Task

**Explore Strobe Pricing and Sign-Up Process**

As a potential customer exploring Strobe.app,
I evaluate the pricing options and sign up for the Creator plan,
so that I can start using Strobe's features to enhance my brand presence.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Strobe.app website
When I navigate to the Pricing page and review the available plans
Then I should clearly see the pricing options for the Creator, Teams, and Enterprise plans, and I should be able to click on the Get Strobe link to reach the sign-up form for the Creator plan.

**Reasoning for action:** I clicked on the Strobe.app link because it's essential to navigate to the specific application where the pricing plans can be found. This action will bring me to the page that displays the various subscription plans, including the Creator plan, which is necessary to evaluate and eventually sign up for.

**Action:** click(38) # Click on the Strobe.app link to explore its features.

**Change Description:** The browser navigated from the Instant Labs website to the Strobe.app website after clicking on the Strobe.app link, changing the displayed content to focus on Strobe's AI-powered social intelligence features, along with updates to the banner, headings, and links relevant to Strobe.

**Reasoning for action:** Clicking on the 'Get Strobe' link (element 532) is crucial because it's the pathway to accessing the sign-up process for the Creator plan. By taking this action, I ensure that I can view the relevant details and complete the registration, thus moving closer to achieving the user's goal of signing up for the Creator plan.

**Action:** click(532) # Click on the Get Strobe link to explore the sign-up process for the Creator plan.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'Get Strobe' link, the browser navigated to the sign-up page for the Creator plan, changing the content to a form where users can enter their details to start using Strobe, which now prominently features the heading 'Start using Strobe today' and fields for Name, Email, and Instagram account username.
