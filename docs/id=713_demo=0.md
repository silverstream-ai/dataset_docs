# Task

**User Story for Website Exploration**

As a website explorer,
I visit multiple websites to check their content,
so that I can find useful information or services relevant to my needs.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the browser with the URL showing 'aboutblank'
When I attempt to navigate to 'httpswww.example.com' multiple times
Then the URL should remain 'aboutblank', indicating that the website did not load.

## Trajectory

**Step 1:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** I initiated a navigation to 'https://www.example.com' in order to fulfill the task of exploring multiple websites for useful information or services. However, based on the acceptance test, the expected outcome is for the URL to remain 'about:blank', suggesting that the website should not load. This means that despite executing the action to navigate, it is crucial to check if the browser respects the condition of keeping the URL unchanged.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser's URL was intended to change to 'https://www.example.com' as an action was taken to navigate to this website, but the final state remains unchanged, indicating that the navigation did not occur or an error prevented it from being executed.

**Step 2:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** In this case, I initiated a navigation action to 'https://www.example.com' because it is the primary step required to explore the content of a website. The goal is to see if this action successfully changes the URL from 'about:blank' to the target site. However, according to the user story's acceptance criteria, the URL remains 'about:blank' if the website does not load, which aligns with the expected outcome of the provided task.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser state remains focused on the 'RootWebArea' with the URL unchanged at 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation to 'https://www.example.com' did not lead to a successful loading of the website.

**Step 3:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** I recognized that the first step required the URL to change from 'about:blank' to 'https://www.example.com'. However, the user's goal is to demonstrate that the URL remains 'about:blank', indicating that the website did not load. By executing the action to go to the website, I deviated from the user's requirement to keep the URL unchanged, which conflicts with the acceptance criteria stating that the 'URL should remain about:blank'. Therefore, this action did not effectively align with completing the task as outlined in the User Story.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser attempted to navigate to 'https://www.example.com', but the state remained unchanged as the URL still shows 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation did not successfully load the new page.
