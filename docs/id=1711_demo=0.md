# Task

**User Experience on Muse Place**

As a website visitor,,
I explore the content on Muse Place,,
so that I can discover alternative routes or information that may interest me.

**Success definition:** Given I have accessed the Muse Place homepage
When I navigate back and forth and attempt to refresh the page
Then I should be informed of a client-side error indicating that further exploration is not possible.

## Trajectory

**Step 1:**

**Url (before/after):** 

https://www.muse.place/

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea Application error: a client-side exception has occurred, focused, url='https://www.muse.place/'
	heading Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information).
	[40] div, center=(960,540), inner_text=Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information).
	alert, atomic
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** Since I am on the Muse Place homepage and I am experiencing a client-side error that prevents further exploration, navigating back to the previous page gives me a chance to access any alternative content that might not be affected by the error. This action aligns with the goal of discovering additional information or routes, as it may allow me to access previously visited content or resources that are still functioning properly.

**Action:** go_back() # Navigate back to the previous page to see if there is an alternative route or information.

**Change Description:** The browser navigated away from the error page at 'https://www.muse.place/' and returned to a blank state represented by 'about:blank', effectively removing the error message and content from view.

**Step 2:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

https://www.muse.place/

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea Application error: a client-side exception has occurred, focused, url='https://www.muse.place/'
	heading Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information).
	[40] div, center=(960,540), inner_text=Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information).
	alert, atomic
```
**Reasoning for action:** I reasoned that using the go_forward() function would allow me to move to the next page in the browsing history, if available. This fits the user's goal of exploring the content on Muse Place and potentially provides information or alternative routes of interest. If there is a valid page to explore, it would fulfill the user's objectives. If there is no page, it would naturally lead to a client-side error, aligning with the acceptance test criteria.

**Action:** go_forward() # Attempt to navigate forward to see if there is a previous page with content.

**Change Description:** After attempting to navigate forward, the browser encountered an application error due to a client-side exception, displaying an error message in the central area of the webpage and maintaining focus on the RootWebArea.

**Step 3:**

**Url (before/after):** 

https://www.muse.place/

https://www.muse.place/

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea Application error: a client-side exception has occurred, focused, url='https://www.muse.place/'
	heading Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information).
	[40] div, center=(960,540), inner_text=Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information).
	alert, atomic
```


```
RootWebArea Application error: a client-side exception has occurred, focused, url='https://www.muse.place/'
	heading Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information).
	[40] div, center=(960,540), inner_text=Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information).
	alert, atomic
```
**Reasoning for action:** My reasoning for this action is to initiate a refresh of the Muse Place homepage directly by navigating back to the same URL. This is intended to check if the application error is still present and if further exploration of the content can be resumed. Given the context states there's an application error, confirming whether it continues after refreshing is necessary to determine the next steps or if a workaround is required.

**Action:** goto('https://www.muse.place/') # Attempt to refresh the page by navigating to the same URL.

**Change Description:** After attempting to refresh the page by navigating to the same URL, the browser state remained unchanged, still displaying the application error message indicating a client-side exception.
