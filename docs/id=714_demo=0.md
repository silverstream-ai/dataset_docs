# Task

**Explore OpsBerry Features and Security**

As a potential customer,
I explore the features and security capabilities of OpsBerry AI,
so that I can evaluate whether it meets my organization's identity management needs.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the OpsBerry AI homepage
When I click on the 'Platform' link and then the 'Data  Security' link
Then I should see detailed information about OpsBerry AI's features and security measures, including SOC2 compliance.

Their platform ensures that we remain, secure, compliant, and efficient in our day-to-day operations and especially around maintain compliance as a public company. Before OpsBerry we had to develop, and manually run scripts to fetch, collate, and review our IAM configurations. This was very time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to maintain. OpsBerry AI has really simplified this process by providing a single pane of glass to view, and manage all our IAM identity configurations and really made managing our cloud identity sprawl seamless. ‚Äù

				StaticText ‚ÄúWe've been using OpsBerry AI to simplify the management of IAM across our cloud infrastructure, and SaaS products. Their platform ensures that we remain, secure, compliant, and efficient in our day-to-day operations and especially around maintain compliance as a public company. Before OpsBerry we had to develop, and manually run scripts to fetch, collate, and review our IAM configurations. This was very time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to maintain. OpsBerry AI has really simplified this process by providing a single pane of glass to view, and manage all our IAM identity configurations and really made managing our cloud identity sprawl seamless. ‚Äù
