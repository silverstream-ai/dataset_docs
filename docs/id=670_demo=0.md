# Task

**Explore Slicker Integrations**

As a product manager,
I discover the integration capabilities of Slicker with various billing platforms,
so that I can evaluate how Slicker can enhance our subscription revenue recovery processes.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Slicker website and want to explore integration options
When I click on the Integrations link and select Chargebee
Then I should see detailed information about the Chargebee integration, including prerequisites and instructions for implementation.

**Reasoning for action:** I identified that the next logical move to fulfill the user story was to click on the 'Integrations' link, since the user wants to explore integration capabilities specifically. By clicking this link, I will be directed to the page that focuses on integrations, which aligns with the task of discovering how Slicker can work with Chargebee for subscription revenue recovery.

**Action:** click(65) # Click on the Features link to explore the features of Slicker.

**Change Description:** The browser navigated to the Features section of Slicker, updating the URL to 'https://www.slickerhq.com/#features' and repositioning the interactive elements accordingly; the Features link is now focused, and the content area displays detailed information about Slicker's features.
