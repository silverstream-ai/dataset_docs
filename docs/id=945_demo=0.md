# Task

**Explore Platform and Contact Support**

As a potential investor,
I understand the benefits and features of the private credit investment platform,
so that I can make an informed decision about whether to invest through Constant.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Constant homepage
When I click on the Benefits link and then the Platform link and finally the Contact link
Then I should see detailed information about the benefits of private credit investments, the features of the platform, and have the option to contact support via email.
