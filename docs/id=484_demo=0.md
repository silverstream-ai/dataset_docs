# Task

**Explore Navier AI Website**

As a potential customer,
I learn more about Navier AI's offerings and team,
so that I can assess their technology and expertise before considering their solutions for my projects.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Navier AI homepage
When I navigate to the Technology section and then to the Founders section
Then I should see detailed information about Navier AI's technology and the backgrounds of its founders.

			StaticText Physics simulations, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), are essential across many industries ranging from the design and analysis of aircraft, to weather prediction, to the development of medical devices. Today’s simulation tools use explicit numerical solvers for physical equations, such as the Navier-Stokes equations. These solvers are complex to setup and can take ages to produce results.
		heading Physics ML
		paragraph
			StaticText Navier AI is building 1000x faster simulations using our physics-ML solver. Our model is trained on massive amounts of high-quality simulations and fine-tuned on experimental data. High precision and accuracy are required for engineering simulations and are core drivers for our product.
		paragraph
			StaticText Our fast CFD platform will enable engineers to quickly explore design spaces and perform analysis-in-the-loop design optimization. We are lowering the barrier to entry for aerospace and mechanical engineers to create high performance designs.
