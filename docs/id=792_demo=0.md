# Task

**Exploring Heat Pump Benefits and Technology**

As a potential customer interested in energy-efficient heating solutions,
I explore the benefits and technology of heat pumps,
so that I can make an informed decision about choosing the best heating solution for my home.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Electric Air website
When I navigate sequentially from the 'How It Works' page to the 'Why Heat Pumps' page and then to the 'Technology' page
Then I should see updated content providing clear information on the benefits of heat pumps and how they work.

		StaticText Heating and cooling is over 50% of a typical home’s energy use. The emissions of just US residential space heating accounts for 1% of global emissions.
		StaticText Not only are furnaces deadly for the environment - they can be bad for your health too. Leaky heat exchangers in your furnace can lead to particulate matter released in your home, or even carbon monoxide poisoning! Switching from a furnace to a heat pump system can be one of the most impactful changes you can make in your life to reduce your carbon footprint, while keeping your family safer and healthier.
	heading The right financial choice
	paragraph
		StaticText A single integrated system provides both heating and cooling, eliminating the need for a separate gas furnace and AC, saving both purchase and maintenance costs.
		StaticText Rebates and low-interest loans often mean that choosing a heat pump can be the most affordable option up front. They significantly reduce your gas bill. When paired with solar panels, a heat pump can offer you guilt free comfort throughout the year - no more expensive gas bills in the winter!

	StaticText Electric Air is a tech-enabled HVAC contractor and venture-backed technology startup making the heat pump buying and installation process easier and cheaper for homeowners.
	paragraph
		StaticText A heat pump packs the functionality of a gas furnace and an air conditioner into a single, simple, all-electric system.
		StaticText And a heat pump is the most meaningful way to electrify your home - space heating is 60% of a typical home’s energy use!
	heading Two Systems. One Technology.
	paragraph
		StaticText Whether we’re replacing your natural gas furnace, or adding mini-splits, the same core heat pump technology heats and cools your home. Electric Air will work with you to determine the best system for your home.

	heading A more efficient, quiet system that produces an even temperature in your home

	heading Variable Speed Inverter Compressor
	paragraph
		StaticText The compressor is the heart of a heat pump, moving refrigerant between the indoor and outdoor heat exchanger. A variable speed system matches the heating and cooling load in your home instead of cycling on and off.

	heading Side Discharge Outdoor Units
	paragraph
		StaticText A typical air conditioner is a big box, taking up unnecessary space. Modern side discharge units have a thin profile that saves meaningful space and enables new mounting locations.

	heading Variable speed ECM Fans and Blower
	paragraph
		StaticText Like the compressor, continually varying the speed of the outdoor fan and the indoor blower matches the load of your home to result in the most efficient and quiet performance relative to single stage (on-off) equipment.
	heading Vapor Injection
	paragraph
		StaticText This vapor compression cycle improvement increases both the operating range of the heat pump, and its overall efficiency.
		StaticText Old heat pump technology stops working at cold temperatures, but modern vapor injected systems run to -15F and colder.
		StaticText From the mild Bay Area, to the freezing winters of Tahoe, a modern heat pump system will keep your family warm all winter and cool in the summer.

	heading Integrate with your smart home
	paragraph
		StaticText In love with your Ecobee or Nest, or looking to upgrade? Our systems pair with 24V smart thermostats, giving you a simple and polished interface for setting schedules and controlling setpoints.
		StaticText Optional integration with your smartphone, as well as Google Home, or Apple Home lets you tap into their respective ecosystems.

	heading Comfort for everyone at home
	heading Zone Control and Remote Temperature Systems
	paragraph
		StaticText Want to keep an office warm during the day, a specific bedroom cold at night, and some other part of the house in between? Zone control dampers change the airflow to specific rooms and control their temperature simultaneously.
		StaticText Another solution we offer is remote temperature sensors, small battery powered devices that you can use as your main temperature control instead of the thermostat.
	heading Air Quality Filters
	paragraph
		StaticText Better air quality for your home starts with a high quality central air filter. We install optional MERV13 and higher filters to keep your air clean, managing allergens, dust and PM2.5.
		StaticText For newer homes built with very little natural air flow, we also offer fresh air intake systems that automatically modulate, reducing the buildup of CO2 and VOC’s in your home.
