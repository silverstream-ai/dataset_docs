# Task

**Explore Yemaachi Biotech Research Initiatives**

As a healthcare researcher,
I explore Yemaachi Biotech's research initiatives,
so that I can understand their clinical studies and contributions to cancer research.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Yemaachi Biotech homepage
When I click on the 'Company' link and then the 'Research' link, followed by the 'Amber Study' heading
Then I should see detailed information about the Amber Study's purpose and methodology, specifically how it focuses on liquid biopsies for detecting genomic mutations in women of African descent with advanced breast cancer.
