# Task

**Accessing UpTrain Documentation**

As a potential user of UpTrain,
I explore the documentation resources for UpTrain,
so that I can understand how to effectively utilize the platform for my LLM applications.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the UpTrain website
When I click on the 'Docs' link
Then I should be redirected to the UpTrain documentation page where I can see the 'Getting Started' section and other helpful resources.

```
**Reasoning for action:** I identified that the user story requires accessing the documentation resources for UpTrain. Since the current browser state indicates that the 'Docs' link is available in the list of navigation links, clicking on it will lead me directly to the documentation page. This is a crucial step as it fulfills the user's need to explore the documentation for effective utilization of the UpTrain platform.

**Action:** click('70') # Click on the 'Try Evals Playground' button to explore that section.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'Try Evals Playground' button, the browser navigated away from the UpTrain platform to a chrome error page, indicating that the intended webpage was not loaded successfully.

**Reasoning for action:** I noticed that the current URL indicates an error page (chrome-error), which suggests that I am not on the UpTrain website. To proceed with the task of accessing the documentation including the 'Docs' link, I need to return to the previous page to regain access to the intended website. This action is necessary to eventually locate the documentation resources and achieve the user's goal.

**Action:** go_back() # Navigate back to the previous page to try accessing the intended content again.

**Change Description:** The browser navigated back to the previous page, successfully displaying the UpTrain website, which features a variety of links, buttons, and images showcasing its functionalities, rather than remaining on the Chrome error page.
