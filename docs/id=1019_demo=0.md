# Task

**User Story for Pre-ordering Index**

As a potential customer interested in Index,
I pre-order the Index product,
so that I can secure my access to the product before its official launch.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Index homepage
When I click on the 'Launch Introducing Index' link and then click the 'Pre-order' button
Then I should be directed to the 'Pre-order Index' page where I can enter my email to confirm my pre-order.

		StaticText Simon Kubica
		StaticText Co-founder
		image, url='https://index.inc/images/Index-3.webp'
		paragraph
			StaticText After two years in stealth, we're excited to announce Index: the new planning and discovery tool for Product Management.
		paragraph
			StaticText Index is here because it‚Äôs time for a new era in Product Management.
		paragraph
			StaticText My top priority at Atlassian, where I spent five years as a PM, was leading product discovery and planning. I‚Äôd brainstorm ideas with my team, collect requests from other groups, and bring plans backed by customer insights to the founders and leadership team.
		paragraph
			StaticText Ultimately, the line between success and failure came down to choosing the right projects, and setting the right direction. But I didn‚Äôt have purpose-built tools ‚Äì I was stuck in issue trackers, or juggling spreadsheets and whiteboards. I knew of legacy PM tools like Productboard and Aha, but they were clunky and not being used by any of the product leaders I looked up to.
		paragraph
			StaticText Fast-forward to today, and issue tracking is undergoing a dramatic transformation ‚Äì Linear is fast becoming the delivery tool of choice for modern engineering teams. But despite engineering now having fast and purpose-built tooling, Product Managers are still juggling Miro, Spreadsheets, and Jira add-ons. None of these tools are connected to the modern workflow and customer context in sales and support tools. Roadmaps are hidden, fragmented, lacking customer insight, and disconnected from engineering work.
		paragraph
			StaticText Product leaders deserve a modern experience for product planning and discovery. Something powerful, flexible, and integrated with the latest tools.
		paragraph
			StaticText That‚Äôs why we built Index, the new standard for Product Management:
		heading Every layout at your fingertips
		paragraph
			StaticText Breeze through planning with a Whiteboard, Table, Roadmap, and Board for every step of the process. One place to go, infinite flexibility, and context on your projects carried throughout.
		image, url='https://index.inc/images/Index-1.webp'
		heading Built for B2B Product Management
		paragraph
			StaticText Natively connect to your customer context, leveraging their requests, insights, and feedback all in one place. Index connects to Hubspot, Intercom, Dovetail, Attio, Gong, and more ‚Äì so you can back up your vision with customer evidence.
		image, url='https://index.inc/images/Index-2.webp'
		heading The product-native companion to Linear
		paragraph
			StaticText To build a true companion to Linear for PMs, we knew we had to raise the bar. Interactions are instant, every layout is collaborative, and it fits Linear like a glove with native sync.
		heading Get started
		paragraph
			StaticText You can
			link pre-order, url='https://index.inc/pre-order'

</details>

**Reasoning for action:** I chose to click on the 'Launch Introducing Index' link because it is essential to gather more information about the product before proceeding with the pre-order. This aligns with the user's intent to understand what they are pre-ordering, ensuring they feel confident in their decision.

**Action:** click('89') # Click on the 'Launch Introducing Index' link to explore more about the product.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'Launch Introducing Index' link, the browser navigated to a new page titled 'Introducing Index', displaying detailed information about the product, including descriptions, images, and a video related to its launch, effectively replacing the previous page content.

**Reasoning for action:** I identified that clicking on the 'Pre-order' button (identified as '64' in the accessibility tree) is essential to navigate to the required page where I can fulfill the user's goal of securing a pre-order for the Index product. This action directly advances the task by transitioning from the current page to the pre-order location, allowing for the next step in verification and completion of the order process.

**Action:** click('64') # Click on the 'Pre-order' button to explore the pre-order options for Index.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'Pre-order' button, the browser navigated to the 'Pre-order Index' page, where the user is prompted to confirm their free pre-order by entering their email address. The page includes options to continue with Linear or Google for the pre-order process.

**Reasoning for action:** By filling in the email textbox with a sample email address, I am providing the required information for the user to confirm their pre-order. This step is crucial because the pre-order process likely requires an email address for future communications and order confirmations. Completing this action moves me closer to successfully placing the pre-order, as the next step would be to submit this information.

**Action:** fill('183', 'example@example.com') # Fill in the email textbox with a sample email address.

**Change Description:** The email textbox was updated to contain the value 'example@example.com', reflecting the email entered by the user.
