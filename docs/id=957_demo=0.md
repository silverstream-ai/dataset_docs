# Task

**User Story for Contact Form Submission**

As a potential client,
I request a demo of Miracle's solutions,
so that I can understand how Miracle can help streamline our clinical trial management.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Miracle website's Contact page
When I fill in the contact form with my details and submit it
Then I should see a success message stating 'Thank you! We will be in touch shortly'.

	paragraph
		StaticText We know how tedious and time-consuming it can be to maintain spreadsheets trackers to manage your clinical trial. This is because your vendor reports and clinical trial systems, such as the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) and lab systems, do not integrate, and your team needs to manually update trackers. With Miracle, we integrate with your clinical trial systems and existing trackers into a fully automated, real-time dashboard.
	StaticText How long does it take to get started with Miracle?

	paragraph
		StaticText Miracle is flexible and customizable. With all your data already in Miracle, it's very easy and quick to spin up new visualizations and create new dashboards, bringing together data from various clinical trial systems (i.e. EDC, labs) into a single unified view. You will also have the ability to drill into any visualizations to obtain more granular details, such as breaking out the number of randomizations across sites and across time. Unlike static reports often found in the EDC or vendor reports, we make it possible for your team to answer new questions that arise throughout your clinical trial. We will be with you every step of the way.
	StaticText Can we provide different levels of access for our Clin-Ops, the executive team, and any other team members?
	image, url='https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64523c92297d423745b40ae3/64523c92297d42f5beb40b94_icon_chevron.svg'
	paragraph
		StaticText Yes. Clinical Operations team members need granular insights on how each of your sites and your vendors are bringing participants into your study. On the other hand, your executive leadership may need top-line metrics and how they are trending, such as screenings, screen failures, and randomizations. Miracle makes it very easy to provision access to different dashboards specific to each role.

	heading FAQ
	StaticText How can you help replace our Excel trackers?
	image, url='https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64523c92297d423745b40ae3/64523c92297d42f5beb40b94_icon_chevron.svg'
	paragraph
		StaticText We know how tedious and time-consuming it can be to maintain spreadsheets trackers to manage your clinical trial. This is because your vendor reports and clinical trial systems, such as the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) and lab systems, do not integrate, and your team needs to manually update trackers. With Miracle, we integrate with your clinical trial systems and existing trackers into a fully automated, real-time dashboard.
	StaticText How long does it take to get started with Miracle?

	StaticText What if we need to create custom reports?

	paragraph
		StaticText Miracle is flexible and customizable. With all your data already in Miracle, it's very easy and quick to spin up new visualizations and create new dashboards, bringing together data from various clinical trial systems (i.e. EDC, labs) into a single unified view. You will also have the ability to drill into any visualizations to obtain more granular details, such as breaking out the number of randomizations across sites and across time. Unlike static reports often found in the EDC or vendor reports, we make it possible for your team to answer new questions that arise throughout your clinical trial. We will be with you every step of the way.
	StaticText Can we provide different levels of access for our Clin-Ops, the executive team, and any other team members?
	image, url='https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64523c92297d423745b40ae3/64523c92297d42f5beb40b94_icon_chevron.svg'
	paragraph
		StaticText Yes. Clinical Operations team members need granular insights on how each of your sites and your vendors are bringing participants into your study. On the other hand, your executive leadership may need top-line metrics and how they are trending, such as screenings, screen failures, and randomizations. Miracle makes it very easy to provision access to different dashboards specific to each role.
