# Task

**Explore Rosebud Biosciences Technology**

As a prospective partner or interested party,
I understand Rosebud Biosciences' innovative organoid technology and its applications,
so that I can assess potential collaboration opportunities and gain insights into their research methods.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Rosebud Biosciences website and looking to learn about their technology
When I click on the Technology link and play the introductory video
Then I should be directed to the Technology section with detailed information about their organoid methods and the video should play, allowing me to engage with the content and learn more.

		StaticText Organoid Platform
	paragraph
		StaticText We model genetic diseases using micropatterned organoids from disease-specific Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSCs), which have major advantages over conventional hiPSC disease modeling. Our circular “2.5D” organoids contain cells from multiple lineages (e.g., embryonic germ layers, endothelial, smooth muscle, fibroblasts) and are differentiated from hiPSCs without the need for complex biopolymer matrices, specialized tissue culture plates, or mixing of differentiated cell types.
	paragraph
		StaticText Due to the relative ease in editing pathogenic mutations in or out of hiPSCs compared to animal models and primary cells, as well as the scale at which they can be produced in a 100% human biological system, hiPSC-derived organoids are ideal for screening small molecules, RNA therapies (e.g., ASOs, siRNAs), CRISPR and other gene therapies, immunotherapies, and more.
	paragraph
		StaticText Rosebud models human development in a dish
	paragraph
		StaticText Rosebud emphasizes longitudinal monitoring of organoids as they transition from the embryonic to the differentiated tissue state. The developing organoids are longitudinally imaged via live cell brightfield microscopy, which can be complemented with biomarker monitoring (e.g., immunostaining, secreted protein ELISAs) and calcium assays.

**Reasoning for action:** I decided to click on the About link first because it is essential to gather foundational knowledge about Rosebud Biosciences, including their goals and previous achievements. This step would help establish a context for the specific technology they utilize and its implications in their research. Although the user requested to learn about the technology specifically, understanding the company as a whole will enhance comprehension of their organoid methods later.

**Action:** click(39) # Click on the About link to learn more about the company.

**Change Description:** After clicking the About link, the browser navigated to the section of the Rosebud Biosciences website pertaining to 'WHO WE ARE', which highlights the company's focus on developing therapies for rare genetic diseases, alongside details about the organization and its team members, showing a significant shift in content focus from the homepage to the company information section.

		StaticText Organoid Platform
	paragraph
		StaticText We model genetic diseases using micropatterned organoids from disease-specific Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSCs), which have major advantages over conventional hiPSC disease modeling. Our circular “2.5D” organoids contain cells from multiple lineages (e.g., embryonic germ layers, endothelial, smooth muscle, fibroblasts) and are differentiated from hiPSCs without the need for complex biopolymer matrices, specialized tissue culture plates, or mixing of differentiated cell types.
	paragraph
		StaticText Due to the relative ease in editing pathogenic mutations in or out of hiPSCs compared to animal models and primary cells, as well as the scale at which they can be produced in a 100% human biological system, hiPSC-derived organoids are ideal for screening small molecules, RNA therapies (e.g., ASOs, siRNAs), CRISPR and other gene therapies, immunotherapies, and more.
	paragraph
		StaticText Rosebud models human development in a dish
	paragraph
		StaticText Rosebud emphasizes longitudinal monitoring of organoids as they transition from the embryonic to the differentiated tissue state. The developing organoids are longitudinally imaged via live cell brightfield microscopy, which can be complemented with biomarker monitoring (e.g., immunostaining, secreted protein ELISAs) and calcium assays.

		StaticText for Genetic Diseases with Rosebud Biosciences
	paragraph
		StaticText Between 5 and 10 percent of humanity has a rare disease, half of whom are children. The future can be especially tragic for these youngest patients - 30% won’t live to see their 5th birthday.
	paragraph
		StaticText This is because only 5% of rare diseases have approved treatments.
		StaticText We want Rosebud to find cures for that remaining 95%.

	paragraph
		StaticText Genetic diseases are a huge unmet need
	paragraph
		StaticText Rosebud Biosciences is an early stage startup that develops therapies for rare genetic diseases in children. We do this by modeling human development with organoids that have the same gene mutation as the child, and screen drugs in these models to find cures.
