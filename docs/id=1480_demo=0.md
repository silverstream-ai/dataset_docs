# Task

**Explore Argument Computer Corporation's Overview**

As a prospective client or partner,
I learn about the company's mission, team, and recent blog updates,
so that I can understand the company's values, the people driving their initiatives, and stay informed on their latest developments.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the homepage of Argument Computer Corporation
When I click on the 'Mission' link, then click on the 'Team' link, and finally click on the 'Blog' link
Then I should see the main content change to reflect the company's mission, team members, and then the latest blog updates, ensuring I have a comprehensive overview of the organization.

</details>

**Reasoning for action:** I chose to click on the 'Mission' link because it is the first step in the user's request to learn about the company. By accessing the 'Mission' page, I will be able to present the essential information regarding the company's values, which is crucial for the user to understand the organization thoroughly. This click will change the main content area to reflect the company's mission statement, fulfilling part of the user's goal.

**Action:** click(33) # Click on the 'Mission' link to explore the company's mission.

**Change Description:** The browser navigated to the 'Mission' page of Argument Computer Corporation, displaying new content including headings and paragraphs detailing the company's mission and verification technologies, while the URL changed to 'https://argument.xyz/mission/'. The previous main content was replaced by mission-specific information and links related to verifiable computing.

He is a co-author of the Yatima compiler, which allows formal proofs of arbitrary size to be compressed into a succinct zero-knowledge proof. His current objective is to compress a formalization of Fermatâ€™s Last Theorem into a zk-proof small enough to fit in a QR-code, and then print the QR-code onto a bookmark with the caption "But it does fit in the margin."
