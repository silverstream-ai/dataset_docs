# Task

**Access Blog Articles on Reframe App**

As a health-conscious individual,
I explore blog content related to drinking habits,
so that I can understand the connection between alcohol consumption and various lifestyle factors.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Reframe App main page
When I click on the Blog section and select an article
Then I should be navigated to the blog articles page and see the content of the selected article titled 'The Connection Between Porn Addiction and Alcohol' with details about the article.

		StaticText Imagine this: we’re kicking back after a long day with a glass (or two) of wine, scrolling through our phone. One click leads to another, and before we know it, we’ve ventured into the realm of adult entertainment. While this scenario may sound harmless at first, it can be the start of an intertwined dependency — leading to long-term consequences.

By understanding the complexities of porn addiction and alcohol abuse, we can better navigate the path to recovery.

				StaticText Behavioral patterns.
			StaticText Key behavioral patterns involved in co-occurrence of porn and alcohol addiction include compulsive use, tolerance, avoidance, and reinforcement. The compulsive nature of these behaviors can lead to excessive time spent consuming alcohol and porn. Over time, this can lead to increased tolerance — requiring more extreme behaviors to get the desired effects. Both alcohol and porn are also used as a means of avoidance — a way to distract yourself or escape. This immediate gratification can reinforce their use as coping mechanisms, making it difficult to break free from addiction.

				StaticText Psychological interplay.
			StaticText Alcohol and porn addiction can often be used as coping mechanisms for one another — escalating addictive behaviors. The act of watching porn can leave us feeling shameful and guilt-ridden. It can drive us to drink as a way to distract us from our uncomfortable feelings. Alcohol can lower our inhibitions and decision-making abilities, increasing the chance of risky behaviors such as watching porn. Although alcohol and porn act on the same pathways in the brain, the complex interaction of psychological factors can reinforce and exacerbate each other.

	paragraph
		StaticText Porn and alcohol addiction alone are often stigmatized and associated with feelings of shame. When combined, these feelings can be even further exacerbated. This can negatively impact our willingness to seek treatment — highlighting the importance of overcoming societal and personal stigma in order to better address these issues.

	paragraph
		StaticText Even when we’re ready to start the road to recovery, accessing treatment for the co-occurrence of alcohol and porn addiction can be challenging. Although specialized treatment programs are available, they aren’t prevalent. Financial barriers and insurance coverage can be obstacles to accessing the care we need. Although navigating alcohol and porn addiction can be difficult, we don’t have to do it alone. Let’s see how we can better support those with porn addiction.
