# Task

**Explore Team Profiles on Engage Bio**

As a visitor to the Engage Bio website,
I explore the team members and their expertise,
so that I can understand the qualifications of the team behind the company's innovative technologies.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Engage Bio platform page
When I click on the 'team' link and then click on Will Olsen's profile link
Then I should see the detailed profile of Will Olsen, including his title, background information, and a link to his LinkedIn profile.

		StaticText Engage’s Tethosome platform solves the two key hurdles that have held back the field non-viral DNA: potency and toxicity. Using proven LNP technology, we deliver a therapeutic DNA and an mRNA encoding our proprietary Tethosome protein. This protein localizes DNA to the nucleus, increasing expression by over 100-fold. Critically, our Tethosome platform is invisible to immune sensors which detect foreign DNA and which can cause lethal immune reactions. This allows us to safely deliver potent DNA, re-dose when needed, and titrate expression to optimal levels.

**Reasoning for action:** I realized that to fulfill the user story, I need to access the team members' information directly. Clicking on the 'team' link (identified by the index 89) will take me to the section of the website where all team members are listed, allowing me to find Will Olsen's profile as specified in the user's instruction.

**Action:** click(87) # Click on the 'platform' link to explore the platform section.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'platform' link, the browser navigated to the platform section of the Engage Bio website, updating the URL to 'https://www.engagebio.com/#platform' and adjusting the focus area to display the new content relevant to the Tethosome platform.

**Reasoning for action:** My reasoning for this action is that the user story explicitly states the need to explore team members and their expertise. By clicking on the 'team' link, I will access the section of the website that is dedicated to showcasing the team members, which is essential for the user to understand the qualifications of the team behind the company's technologies.

**Action:** click(89) # Click on the 'team' link to explore the team section.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'team' link, the browser navigated to the team section of the Engage Bio website, updating the URL to 'https://www.engagebio.com/#team' and changing the vertical positioning of elements, including updating the centers of the navigation links and displaying team member links along with their associated images and details.

	heading PLATFORM
	heading Engage Bio has developed Tethosomes, a new class of non-viral DNA which finally unleashes potent, durable, redosable, and scalable genetic medicine.
	paragraph
		StaticText Engage’s Tethosome platform solves the two key hurdles that have held back the field non-viral DNA: potency and toxicity. Using proven LNP technology, we deliver a therapeutic DNA and an mRNA encoding our proprietary Tethosome protein. This protein localizes DNA to the nucleus, increasing expression by over 100-fold. Critically, our Tethosome platform is invisible to immune sensors which detect foreign DNA and which can cause lethal immune reactions. This allows us to safely deliver potent DNA, re-dose when needed, and titrate expression to optimal levels.

**Reasoning for action:** I clicked on Will Olsen's link because it is part of the user story's requirements to explore the team members and their expertise. By doing this, I move closer to fulfilling the acceptance test, which states that I should see his detailed profile including his title and background information after following the link.

**Action:** click(185) # Click on Will Olsen's link to view his detailed profile.

**Change Description:** After clicking on Will Olsen's link, the browser transitioned to his detailed profile page, which now displays his name and title (CEO), along with a paragraph detailing his background, previous roles, and a link to his LinkedIn profile.
