# Task

**Explore Finance Solutions of OmniAI**

As a finance professional,
I explore solutions for automating earnings call analysis,
so that I can gain insights from earnings transcripts to support informed investment decisions.

**Success definition:** Given I have accessed the OmniAI homepage and am interested in finance solutions
When I navigate to the Finance section and select the Earnings call analysis solution
Then I should see detailed information about the Earnings call analysis, including its benefits and how it can be used to extract insights from transcripts.

**Reasoning for action:** By clicking on the Finance option identified by '293', I direct the browser to display finance-related solutions. This is a crucial step toward finding the Earnings call analysis solution, as it allows me to view all available offerings in the finance category, which contributes to my goal of exploring automation solutions for earnings call analysis.

**Action:** click('293') # Click on the Finance option to explore the finance solutions offered by OmniAI.

**Change Description:** After clicking on the Finance option, the browser's URL was updated to 'https://getomni.ai/?category=finance#solutions', and the Solutions menu's state changed to collapsed. The Finance button is now focused and appears in a new location on the page, allowing for exploration of finance-related solutions provided by OmniAI.
