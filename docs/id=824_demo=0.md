# Task

**User Story for Exploring Features and Pricing**

As a construction project manager,
I explore the features and pricing of the Constructable tool,
so that I can evaluate its suitability for improving our project management processes.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Constructable homepage
When I click on the Features link and then on the Pricing link
Then I should be able to view detailed information about the features offered and the associated pricing for different service plans, including specific functionalities such as Drawings and Collaboration.

**Reasoning for action:** I decided to click on the 'Drawings and Collaboration' feature link because the user story emphasizes the need to evaluate the specific functionalities of the Constructable tool. By accessing this information, I can directly assess how this feature could potentially enhance project management processes, thus moving closer to meeting the user's goal of suitability evaluation.

**Action:** click(234) # Click on the Drawings and Collaboration feature to learn more about it.

**Change Description:** After clicking on the 'Drawings and Collaboration' feature, the information displayed in the tab panel has shifted its focus to expand on the topic of 'Drawings', which includes details on uploading, viewing, and annotating construction drawings directly from devices, thereby enhancing user interaction with the feature.
