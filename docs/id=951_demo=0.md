# Task

**User Journey through Lume AI Blog and Demo Booking**

As a potential customer interested in Lume AI's offerings,,
I explore blog content to understand recent developments and access demo scheduling options,,
so that I can stay informed about Lume AI's initiatives and easily arrange a demonstration to assess how their services can benefit my business.

**Success definition:** Given I am a visitor on the Lume AI website
When I navigate through the blog and click to book a demo
Then I should see an article detailing Lume AI's recent funding round, and upon clicking the 'Book a call' link, I should be redirected to an appointment scheduling interface.

	heading The Complex Challenge of Data Integrations
		strong
	paragraph
		StaticText Since the birth of databases 60 years ago, moving data seamlessly between systems has been an unsolved problem. Despite technological advancements, data integration has largely remained a manual process due to the unique nature of every data system.
	paragraph
		StaticText Companies and vendors structure and interpret data differently, making reformatting data (known as data mapping or data transformations) a complex, human-centric problem. These variations are infinite and cannot be encapsulated in any one algorithm. Thus, data integrations are iterative and unscalable today. Companies dedicate disproportionate resources to integrating data, bottlenecking their scalability. Engineers, including data scientists, data engineers, customer success engineers, and solutions engineers, spend considerable time manually onboarding new customer data systems or creating data integrations for new applications.
	paragraph
		StaticText The data speaks for itself: on average, prospects spend ~5 weeks to map to a new system, whether it’s a customer’s system or a new internal integration. Some Lume customers used to spend up to 4 months per customer strictly on data integration, with reports of teams spending over 11 months on the process.
	paragraph
		StaticText After speaking with hundreds of software companies, it’s clear that data integrations, and specifically data mapping, are massive bottlenecks that drain engineering resources and limit growth. The core challenge is twofold: understanding the new data system and executing the engineering work to move data between systems. Lume’s AI addresses both challenges.

				StaticText For an early-stage financial product startup, Lume manages ~1500 live data pipelines piping millions of data batches, which are externally facing, continually adapting to new incoming data.
	paragraph
		StaticText These examples highlight the common underlying theme of mapping data between unique schemas, where even discrepancies as minor as column name variations make this process time-consuming and near-impossible to automate. This worsens at scale. Clients previously allocated engineers, customer success teams, or offshore labor to analyze, map, and route incoming data to new systems. This process took months and incurred significant costs.

		StaticText As data systems continue to evolve, Lume ensures that businesses are not just keeping up with AI, but staying ahead, as shown by the use cases above. Whether it's drastically reducing onboarding times or managing hundreds of data pipelines with ease, Lume empowers teams to achieve their goals faster and with greater confidence. In the long term, Lume will be the glue that connects any data system.
