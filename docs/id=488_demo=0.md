# Task

**User Journey to Explore Pricing and Demo Options**

As a prospective customer,
I understand the pricing options and sign up for a demo of Risotto's services,
so that I can evaluate if Risotto is the right solution for my organization's IT help desk needs.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Risotto homepage
When I click the 'How it works' link, then the 'Pricing' link, and finally the 'Get started for free' link
Then I should be navigated to the pricing page first, where I can see the cost structure and trial options, followed by the demo page where I can fill out a sign-up form for further engagement.

**Reasoning for action:** I first needed to understand the pricing options for Risotto's services to notify the prospective customer about the pricing structure and trials. By clicking on the 'Pricing' link, I'm advancing toward retrieving the necessary information that the user requires to evaluate if Risotto is suitable for their IT help desk needs. This action ensures I can gather the cost details and any trial offerings, fulfilling a crucial part of the user story.

**Action:** click('1025') # Click on the 'Pricing' link to explore the cost structure of Risotto's services.

**Change Description:** The browser navigated from the 'How it Works' page to the 'Pricing' page of the Risotto website, updating the title and content to reflect the pricing details and features available, such as a 30-day free trial, various support options, and links to book a demo.

**Reasoning for action:** I chose to click on the 'Get started for free' link because it aligns with the user's goal of signing up for a demo of Risotto's services. By clicking this link, I am directly moving towards the demo sign-up process, allowing the user to evaluate whether Risotto is the right solution for their organization's IT help desk needs. This action takes me to the pricing page first, fulfilling the requirement stated in the success criteria.

**Action:** click('1239') # Click on the 'Get started for free' link to explore the sign-up process.

**Change Description:** The browser navigated from the 'Pricing' page to the 'Demo' page of Risotto, which now features a new focus on getting a free demo of the ticketing and provisioning automation in Slack, replacing the pricing-specific content with a sign-up form and additional promotional details.
