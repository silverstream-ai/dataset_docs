		StaticText About the role
	paragraph
		StaticText You are a jack-of-all-trades technical wizard with a diverse skill set, ranging from web UX to database design. You have a proven track record of building applications end-to-end at incredible velocity (in days, not weeks). You're naturally self-sufficient, often finding it easier to learn and implement new technologies yourself, instead of relying on others.
	paragraph
		StaticText Whether you are hooking up a new API, building an end-to-end web stack, or designing a scalable architecture, each new technology brings you a unique reward: an improved understanding of the big picture and how the puzzle fits together.
	paragraph
		StaticText But why are you so motivated to keep learning?
	paragraph
		StaticText Because your biggest fear is that you will look back in 20 years, and realize you never made a difference. You were simply a tiny cog in a large machine, that will churn with or without you.
	paragraph
		StaticText Due to your reputation as someone who gets things done, you've received a fair share of attractive offers over the years. But although money is important, it is not your primary motivator.
	paragraph
		StaticText Instead, you feel compelled to build a product that will make a true impact on others. You want to work on the frontier of a new technology to solve a big problem in the real world. Because to you, meaningful work is no different than play. You crave adventure, excitement, and a journey into the unknown. Where a new day brings a new challenge knocking on your door.
	paragraph
		StaticText You are a self starter who excels both independently and in a team. You dislike corporate structure and bureaucracy, and believe in a "best idea wins" meritocracy. This is why you prefer a growth-oriented, flat, startup environment.

		StaticText About the role
	paragraph
		StaticText You are a jack-of-all-trades technical wizard with a diverse skill set, ranging from web UX to database design. You have a proven track record of building applications end-to-end at incredible velocity (in days, not weeks). You're naturally self-sufficient, often finding it easier to learn and implement new technologies yourself, instead of relying on others.
	paragraph
		StaticText Whether you are hooking up a new API, building an end-to-end web stack, or designing a scalable architecture, each new technology brings you a unique reward: an improved understanding of the big picture and how the puzzle fits together.
	paragraph
		StaticText But why are you so motivated to keep learning?
	paragraph
		StaticText Because your biggest fear is that you will look back in 20 years, and realize you never made a difference. You were simply a tiny cog in a large machine, that will churn with or without you.
	paragraph
		StaticText Due to your reputation as someone who gets things done, you've received a fair share of attractive offers over the years. But although money is important, it is not your primary motivator.
	paragraph
		StaticText Instead, you feel compelled to build a product that will make a true impact on others. You want to work on the frontier of a new technology to solve a big problem in the real world. Because to you, meaningful work is no different than play. You crave adventure, excitement, and a journey into the unknown. Where a new day brings a new challenge knocking on your door.
	paragraph
		StaticText You are a self starter who excels both independently and in a team. You dislike corporate structure and bureaucracy, and believe in a "best idea wins" meritocracy. This is why you prefer a growth-oriented, flat, startup environment.
