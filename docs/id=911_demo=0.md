# Task

**Navigation Exploration**

As a A curious internet user,
I browse various websites to explore their content,
so that I can gather information and learn about different topics.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the browser with an empty page
When I attempt to navigate to 'httpswww.example.com' and 'httpswww.wikipedia.org'
Then I should still see the URL as 'aboutblank', indicating that the navigation failed.

## Trajectory

**Step 1:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** My reasoning for this action is based on the user's goal of exploring various websites to gather information. By trying to navigate to 'https://www.example.com', I can access its content and resources. However, since the acceptance criteria states that the URL should remain 'about:blank', indicating a failed navigation, I need to ensure that any navigation attempt does not succeed. This action is intended to test the browser's state and observe if it meets the criteria outlined.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser attempted to navigate to 'https://www.example.com', but the URL remained unchanged as 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation may not have been successful or completed.

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** My reasoning for taking this action is that it aligns with the user's story of exploring various websites to gather information. The user indicated an interest in accessing 'https://www.example.com'. By initiating this navigation, I am effectively attempting to fulfill the user's objective of learning about different topics, despite the acceptance test stating that the URL should remain as 'about:blank'. This action helps in understanding how the browser reacts to a navigation attempt under those specific circumstances.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser remained on the same page (url='about:blank') and did not navigate to 'https://www.example.com', indicating that the action to load the new website was unsuccessful.

**Step 3:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** My reasoning for this action is that the user story mentions that the user intends to explore content on various websites. Therefore, attempting to navigate to a valuable informational resource like Wikipedia aligns with their goal. However, I need to keep in mind the success criteria that indicates the navigation should fail and the URL should remain 'about:blank', indicating that I need to ensure the navigation does not succeed.

**Action:** goto('https://www.wikipedia.org') # Navigate to Wikipedia to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser attempted to navigate to 'https://www.wikipedia.org', but the URL in the final state still shows 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation did not successfully occur.
