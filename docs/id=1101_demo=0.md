# Task

**User Inquiry Submission**

As a potential customer looking for loan servicing solutions,
I submit an inquiry about services offered by Salient,
so that I can receive information tailored to my company's needs.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Salient contact page with the inquiry form visible
When I fill out the form with my name, email, company size, and request for more information and submit it
Then I should receive a confirmation message indicating my inquiry was successfully submitted and that someone will get back to me shortly.

**Reasoning for action:** My reasoning for this action was to transition from the current page to the contact page where the inquiry form is located. Since the user story requires completing an inquiry about loan servicing solutions, accessing the contact page is a crucial step in ensuring that I can gather the necessary information and ultimately submit the inquiry.

**Action:** click('54') # Click on the 'Get In Touch' link to explore contact options.

**Change Description:** The browser navigated from the main overview page of Salient to the 'Contact Sales' page, where users can fill out a contact form to request customized solutions, replacing the previous content with fields for full name, work email, company size, and assistance required.

**Reasoning for action:** Filling in the full name is essential as it directly meets one of the required inputs in the inquiry form. This step is necessary for completing the submission process and moves us closer to fulfilling the user's request for loan servicing information.

**Action:** fill('538', 'John Doe') # Fill in the full name
fill('543', 'john@example.com') # Fill in the work email
select_option('548', ['50-100']) # Select company size
fill('558', 'I would like to know more about your services.') # Fill in the help request
click('560') # Click on the 'Send message' button to submit the form.

**Change Description:** The contact form was filled with the name 'John Doe', email 'john@example.com', company size set to '50-100', and the request 'I would like to know more about your services.' An alert was triggered indicating an issue with the format of the email address.

**Reasoning for action:** I recognized that the current work email was not in an acceptable format due to the presence of a space and potential invalid characters in 'John Doejohn@example.com'. The form requires a valid email address to allow submission successfully. By correcting it to 'john.doe@example.com', I ensured that the email format will meet validation requirements, allowing for proper processing of the inquiry when the form is submitted.

**Action:** fill('543', 'john.doe@example.com') # Update the work email to a valid format.

**Change Description:** The work email textbox was updated to a valid email format, changing the value from 'John Doejohn@example.com' to 'john.doe@example.com', ensuring it complies with the required format for email entries.
