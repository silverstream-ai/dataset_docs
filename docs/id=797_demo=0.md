# Task

**Estimate Process Exploration**

As a potential customer,
I explore the interior painting estimate process,
so that I can understand the services and pricing for my home painting project.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Craftwork homepage
When I click on the 'Free Estimate' button and select 'Interior' for my painting preferences
Then I should see the interior painting services page with detailed descriptions and images, confirming my estimate preferences.

**Reasoning for action:** I clicked on the 'Free Estimate' button (element 116) because this is the first step needed to explore the interior painting estimate process. By doing so, I initiate the user's journey to understand the pricing and services for their home painting project. This action aligns directly with the user story's goal of exploring the estimate process.

**Action:** click(116) # Click on the 'Free Estimate' button to explore the estimate process.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'Free Estimate' button, the initial content was replaced by a new interface prompting the user to select the type of painting project (Interior, Exterior, or Cabinets) with radio buttons for each option. Additionally, new buttons labeled 'Cancel' and 'Next' were introduced to facilitate navigation through the estimate process.

**Reasoning for action:** I clicked on the 'Interior' radio button because the user specifically indicated an interest in exploring interior painting services. By selecting this option, I ensure that the estimate process will reflect the user's preference for interior painting, which is a crucial step toward reaching the intended services and pricing details needed for their home painting project.

**Action:** click(620) # Click on the 'Interior' option to proceed with the estimate.

**Change Description:** After clicking on the 'Interior' option, the selection state of the related radio button changed to 'checked' for the Interior option, indicating it is now the active choice for the estimate, while the other options (Exterior and Cabinets) remain unchecked.

			StaticText Craftwork made it easy to select paint colors and their blog posts help guide you in selecting colors and paint type for your specific project. The team is responsive and ensures you’ve made the selections for your project. The Craftwork team showed up promptly at the agreed upon start time and communicated effectively about subsequent days schedule. They were professional, provided everything needed to complete the job, and the paint job looked excellent. I will definitely be hiring Craftwork for future projects and I would highly recommend their services to anyone looking to paint their home.

			StaticText 5 MILLION STARS!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ I cannot say enough good things about the people, the quality, and the customer service. I am a real estate broker, my colleague, recommended Omar and the team at Craftwork to me. They painted the entire interior of my home, and I will not hesitate to recommend them to family, friends and clients alike! From quote to finish it’s been an incredible experience!

			StaticText After a not so great experience with another painting company my husband and I were hesitant to hire another crew in our new home. However, we were blown away by the thoroughness, professionalism and talent displayed by the crew at Craftwork. One of our rooms was tricky and instead of rushing the job the owner and the crew came out on a Saturday to ensure they were happy with the final product which was amazing! We were so happy with the work we added additional spaces to be painted. I cannot recommend Craftwork enough!

			StaticText We could not be more impressed by the team and flawless paint job by Craftwork. They were super professional throughout the entire process and all were very nice and easy to work with. It's no secret that an important part of the job is prep, and not a drop of paint was left behind. The quality of the work was A++. We had them do a speciality lime wash technique in one of the rooms which came out amazing, as well as cabinets which were done beautifully in high gloss. I am currently scheduling them for more work because my experience was so great and feel like my other rooms are lackluster without their touch. Highly recommend this team.

			StaticText I’m a designer so I can be pretty picky when it comes to the details. I started painting myself because I wanted perfect clean lines. I’ve hired painters before, but I found that the attention to detail just wasn’t there. I will say, I was really impressed with the quality of work from Craftwork. Their entire process was professional, easy, and polished. Our painters arrived on time and immediately set to work covering the floor and setting up their workspace. Our very small half bathroom was beautifully painted and there wasn’t a single drip or smudge. They even painted the door and the lines were ultra clean. I also had requested touch-ups throughout the house, and Andres gave some professional insight that I really appreciated. He said that after a few years sometimes there won’t be an exact match (likely because of UV aging), so he tested one wall to show me an example. His communication, expertise, and attention to detail were level above other painters! To top it all off, the onboarding process is really slick and easy. I highly recommend!!!

			StaticText I needed a few rooms painted in my house and didn’t know where to start. Craftwork made the process seamless from the moment I got a quote online, to picking the right colors, to having an incredible crew of painters finish both rooms in just a matter of hours. I couldn’t be more pleased with the quality of the results, and the ease and grace in which the Craftwork team transformed my space. If you’re looking to get your home repainted and you live nearby, think no further! Charlotte is lucky to have a service like this one!

			StaticText I recently had the pleasure of having Craftwork paint several interior spaces of my home, and I am extremely impressed with the level of professionalism and quality of work they provided. From the initial contact to the final walkthrough, the team was friendly, communicative, and focused on meeting my needs. They're adding technology to the process, and it's fantastic! Estimates were provided utilizing photos & videos, choices/preferences are entered via an online form, and I received an excellent summary email a couple days before the work to confirm everything. I even threw a couple last-minute changes at them, and they were handled with no issues. The crew arrived on time each day and were always respectful of my home, taking extra care to protect my floors, furniture, and other belongings. They worked efficiently and diligently, ensuring that every surface was properly prepared and painted to perfection. The end result is stunning, and I couldn't be happier with the work they did. Overall, I highly recommend Craftwork for anyone looking for a professional and reliable painting service. They exceeded my expectations in every way, and I will certainly be using them again for future projects. Thank you, Craftwork, for a job well done!

			StaticText Best painter experience we’ve ever had. Getting a quote was quick and simple and didn’t require anyone to come to our house. Communication was superb and clear. Loved the Project Schedule we got ahead of the time that outlined our preferences, the timeline and introduced us to the painters (including their photos). The painters themselves were great. Omar led the team and was proactive in all communication. The team did a superb job painting our rooms and was extremely professional and courteous throughout. Highly recommend working with Craftwork!

I received an email the week of my job telling me exactly which colors would be used, the names and pictures of the painters who would be doing the job, a schedule for the day, and contact info for the manager in case I needed anything. The guys who did the work were professional and skilled, our house looks great!
