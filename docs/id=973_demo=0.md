# Task

**User Journey through Cardinal's Features and Pricing**

As a prospective customer,
I explore the features and pricing of Cardinal,
so that I can make an informed decision about using the product for my product management needs.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Cardinal website
When I click on the 'We've been acquired!' link and subsequently navigate to the 'Features' and 'Pricing' sections
Then I should be able to view detailed descriptions of Cardinal's features and the various pricing options available.

**Reasoning for action:** My reasoning for this action was to directly access the 'Features' section of the Cardinal website. Since the user story requires exploring the features of Cardinal, clicking on this link is essential to obtaining the necessary information to evaluate how Cardinal can meet their product management needs.

**Action:** click(2539) # Click on the 'Features' link to explore Cardinal's offerings.

**Change Description:** The browser state changed from displaying the initial blog post about Cardinal's acquisition by Miro to presenting the 'Features' page of the Cardinal product, providing users with information on Cardinal's offerings and features relevant to product management.

This step is crucial in fulfilling the user's objective of making an informed decision about using Cardinal for their product management needs. By clicking this link, I am directly moving towards the user‚Äôs goal of comparing features and pricing.

**Action:** click(2698) # Click on the 'Pricing' link to explore the pricing options for Cardinal.

**Change Description:** The browser navigated to the 'Pricing' section of the Cardinal website, changing the URL to 'https://cardinalapp.io/pricing'. The focus shifted from the features information to displaying pricing options, including a 15-day free trial with no hidden costs and different pricing tiers for Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans.
