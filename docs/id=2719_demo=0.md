# Task

**User Story for Scheduling a Demo**

As a potential customer of Velostics,
I schedule a demo for the Dock Scheduling Software,
so that I can evaluate the software's features and capabilities for my scheduling needs.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Velostics platform page
When I click on the 'Get a demo' button
Then I should be directed to the demo scheduling page where I can choose a date and time for my demo.

**Reasoning for action:** Since I have landed on a 404 error page, it indicates that the Velostics platform page I need to access is not available. To progress toward my goal of scheduling a demo, I need to get away from this error and try to go back to the previous page. This will give me an opportunity to find another link or option that may lead me to the correct page where I can find the 'Get a demo' button.

**Action:** go_back() # Navigate back to the previous page in history.

**Change Description:** After the action taken by the web agent to navigate back, the browser state changed from displaying a '404 - Page not found' error page to successfully loading the 'Unified Scheduling Platform' webpage of Velostics, with a comprehensive layout including headers, paragraphs, images, and navigation links.
