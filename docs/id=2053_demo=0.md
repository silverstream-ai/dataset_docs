# Task

**User Story for Exploring Products on Floatpays**

As a prospective customer,
I explore the employee benefits products offered by Floatpays,
so that I can understand the different solutions available for enhancing employee financial wellness.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Floatpays homepage
When I click on the PRODUCTS button and select the EARNED WAGE ACCESS link from the dropdown menu
Then I should see the Earned Wage Access product page, which includes detailed information about its features and benefits.

**Reasoning for action:** I clicked on the PRODUCTS button because it is necessary to access the dropdown menu that will lead me to the Earned Wage Access link. This step is essential to navigate towards the page that provides detailed information about the Earned Wage Access product. By taking this action, I am one step closer to reaching the specific product page that contains the information of interest.

**Action:** click(38) # Click on the PRODUCTS button to explore the offerings.

**Change Description:** After clicking the PRODUCTS button, the browser state highlighted the PRODUCTS button as focused, indicating it is now selected and awaiting further interaction, but the content of the page remains unchanged and no additional menu is displayed.

**Reasoning for action:** I started by clicking on the PRODUCTS button because this is the first step required to access the product offerings on Floatpays. As the action confirmed if the button expands into a dropdown menu, it enables me to identify the specific link needed to view information about the Earned Wage Access product, thus directing me towards the goal of exploring employee benefits products.

**Action:** click(38) # Click on the PRODUCTS button again to see if it expands a menu or navigates to a product page.

**Change Description:** After clicking the PRODUCTS button, the navigation expanded to reveal a dropdown menu containing links to specific products such as Automated Savings, Earned Wage Access, Rewards, Pension-Backed Home Loans, Financial Wellness Tools, and Employee Communications Platform.
