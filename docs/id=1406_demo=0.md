# Task

**User Journey on Plumter Website**

As a potential customer,
I explore information about Plumter's company background and resources,
so that I can better understand their services and ensure they meet my business payments needs.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Plumter website and have not yet logged in
When I click on the 'Company' button, then the 'About Us' link, and finally the 'Resources' button
Then I should be directed to the About Us page showing the company's background and values, and then to the Resources section that lists Helpdesk and document verification options.
