# Task

**Exploring TYBR Health Sections**

As a potential customer interested in innovative post-operative solutions,
I learn more about TYBR Health's technology and mission,
so that I can understand how their products may improve recovery after surgery.

**Success definition:** Given I have accessed the TYBR Health website
When I click on the Technology link and then the About link and return to Technology
Then I should be able to navigate between the Technology and About sections seamlessly, and I should see the relevant content pertaining to each section updating accordingly.
