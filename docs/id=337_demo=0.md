# Task

**Join Camfer Waitlist**

As a potential user of Camfer's services,
I join the waitlist to access Camfer for my CAD tasks,
so that I can have early access to the features and tools that will enhance my mechanical engineering projects.

**Success definition:** Given I am a visitor on the Camfer website and have accessed the 'Try Camfer' page
When I fill in my details with my name, email, and select my experience level, then click the submit button
Then I should receive a prompt indicating that my email needs to be filled out and still see my input details prominently displayed on the form.

**Reasoning for action:** By filling in the name field with 'John Doe', the email field with 'john.doe@example.com', and selecting 'Hobbyist' in the experience level dropdown menu, I am completing the form as a potential user of Camfer's services. This action is necessary to mimic the user experience outlined in the user story and success criteria. The subsequent step will be submitting this form to see if the validations and prompts from the application behave as expected.

**Action:** fill('38', 'John Doe') # Fill in the name field with a sample name
fill('40', 'john.doe@example.com') # Fill in the email field with a sample email
select_option('42', ['Hobbyist']) # Select 'Hobbyist' as the experience level

**Change Description:** The 'Your Name' textbox is now filled with 'John Doe', the 'you@example.com' textbox contains 'john.doe@example.com', and the experience level combobox has selected 'Hobbyist', updating the user input fields accordingly.

**Reasoning for action:** I needed to verify the behavior of the form submission to ensure I met the success criteria of the user story. By clicking the submit button, I'm triggering the form validation process. This should reveal whether or not the form recognizes the email field's contents correctly and if the prompt appears informing me of any errors while still displaying my input details.

**Action:** click('52') # Click on the submit button to join the waitlist.

**Change Description:** After clicking the submit button, an alert was triggered indicating that the email field needs to be filled out, while the overall state of the webpage remained unchanged with the form still visible and the same initial inputs present.
