# Task

**Explore Blog and Request Access**

As a potential customer,
I explore informative blog content about RCS messaging,
so that I can understand how it compares to other messaging technologies and determine if I should request access for my business.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Smobi blog homepage
When I click on a blog post and then click the Request Access link
Then I should see the article 'RCS vs SMS Which Messaging Technology is Better?' displayed and be taken to the Smobi Intake Form.

**Reasoning for action:** I reasoned that in order to explore informative blog content about RCS messaging, I need to first access the blog section of the Smobi website. Clicking the 'Blog' link (identified as link '56') allows me to do that, which is an essential step towards finding the article 'RCS vs SMS Which Messaging Technology is Better?'. Therefore, this action directly moves me closer to fulfilling the user's goal of learning about RCS messaging.

**Action:** click('56') # Click on the Blog link to explore more content.

**Change Description:** The browser navigated from the main page of Smobi to its blog section, changing the URL to 'https://smobi.com/blog' and updating the content to display a new heading 'Our Resources' along with relevant blog posts, such as 'RCS vs SMS: Which Messaging Technology is Better?'. The previous links to the home page and request access are still present, but the focus shifted to blog-related content.

		StaticText In today’s digital age, messaging has become the core of how we communicate with one another, connecting not only friends and families but also businesses with consumers. While SMS messaging has been the standard for text communication since the 1990s, a new protocol known as Rich Communication Services (RCS) is emerging which is expected to overtake SMS. RCS is being heralded as the next big leap in messaging, offering new interactive elements and more flexible messaging. In this post, we’ll explore what RCS is, how it differs from SMS, and what the future looks like with RCS support.
	heading What is RCS Messaging?
		strong
	paragraph
		StaticText Rich Communication Services, or RCS, is a next-generation messaging protocol developed to replace SMS, bringing modern, app-like functionality directly into native messaging apps. RCS supports both person-to-person (P2P) and application-to-person (A2P) messaging, which means it’s geared not only for individual conversations but also for businesses to engage with customers. Unlike SMS, which is limited in features, RCS enables advanced message capabilities such as file sharing, read receipts, and rich media—all delivered over data or Wi-Fi rather than traditional cellular networks, making messaging both cheaper and richer in experience.

	heading Key Features of RCS
		strong
	paragraph
		StaticText RCS is packed with features that make it a substantial upgrade over SMS, bridging the gap between basic text messaging and the richer experiences people expect from modern communication apps. Here’s a closer look at what RCS brings to the table:

					StaticText Rich Media Capabilities
				StaticText : Unlike SMS, which limits users to plain text or basic image attachments, RCS supports sharing of a wide range of media, including high-resolution images, videos, and GIFs. Users can also send document attachments like PDFs, making RCS ideal for both personal and professional communication.
		listitem
			StaticText •
			paragraph
				strong
					StaticText Verified Branding for Businesses
				StaticText : One of the standout features of RCS is the ability for businesses to verify their identity. This means that users can be assured they’re interacting with legitimate companies rather than potential spammers. Verified branding establishes trust by building credibility, especially as more consumers use messaging to interact with brands for customer support, promotions, and service inquiries.
		listitem
			StaticText •
			paragraph
				strong
					StaticText End-to-End Encryption
				StaticText : Privacy is a major concern in digital communication, and RCS addresses this with end-to-end encryption for enhanced security. This encryption means that only the sender and recipient can read the messages, offering peace of mind that sensitive information remains private. End-to-end encryption puts RCS on par with secure messaging apps, ensuring user conversations are protected against potential eavesdropping or data breaches.
		listitem
			StaticText •
			paragraph
				strong
					StaticText Enhanced Message Types
				StaticText : RCS doesn’t just improve text messaging—it redefines it with interactive elements like carousels, rich cards, and suggested action buttons. For example, businesses can create messages that include product images in a carousel format, allowing users to scroll through options without leaving the messaging app. Action buttons enable users to book appointments, make purchases, or follow links directly from the message. This level of interactivity creates a smoother, more convenient experience, enabling users to take action immediately, without having to switch to a different app or website.

				StaticText : RCS brings long-awaited features to messaging, such as read receipts, typing indicators, and the ability to create group chats with seamless functionality. These additions allow users to see when someone is typing, when a message has been delivered, and when it’s been read, adding a layer of real-time awareness to conversations. Importantly, RCS supports group messaging between Android and Apple devices, creating a cross-platform experience that finally enables group chats with advanced capabilities across these ecosystems. This functionality mimics the experience users have come to expect from services like iMessage, fostering a unified messaging experience across platforms.

		StaticText In today’s digital age, messaging has become the core of how we communicate with one another, connecting not only friends and families but also businesses with consumers. While SMS messaging has been the standard for text communication since the 1990s, a new protocol known as Rich Communication Services (RCS) is emerging which is expected to overtake SMS. RCS is being heralded as the next big leap in messaging, offering new interactive elements and more flexible messaging. In this post, we’ll explore what RCS is, how it differs from SMS, and what the future looks like with RCS support.
	heading What is RCS Messaging?
		strong
	paragraph
		StaticText Rich Communication Services, or RCS, is a next-generation messaging protocol developed to replace SMS, bringing modern, app-like functionality directly into native messaging apps. RCS supports both person-to-person (P2P) and application-to-person (A2P) messaging, which means it’s geared not only for individual conversations but also for businesses to engage with customers. Unlike SMS, which is limited in features, RCS enables advanced message capabilities such as file sharing, read receipts, and rich media—all delivered over data or Wi-Fi rather than traditional cellular networks, making messaging both cheaper and richer in experience.

	heading Key Features of RCS

	paragraph
		StaticText RCS is packed with features that make it a substantial upgrade over SMS, bridging the gap between basic text messaging and the richer experiences people expect from modern communication apps. Here’s a closer look at what RCS brings to the table:

					StaticText Rich Media Capabilities
				StaticText : Unlike SMS, which limits users to plain text or basic image attachments, RCS supports sharing of a wide range of media, including high-resolution images, videos, and GIFs. Users can also send document attachments like PDFs, making RCS ideal for both personal and professional communication.
		listitem

					StaticText Verified Branding for Businesses
				StaticText : One of the standout features of RCS is the ability for businesses to verify their identity. This means that users can be assured they’re interacting with legitimate companies rather than potential spammers. Verified branding establishes trust by building credibility, especially as more consumers use messaging to interact with brands for customer support, promotions, and service inquiries.

					StaticText End-to-End Encryption
				StaticText : Privacy is a major concern in digital communication, and RCS addresses this with end-to-end encryption for enhanced security. This encryption means that only the sender and recipient can read the messages, offering peace of mind that sensitive information remains private. End-to-end encryption puts RCS on par with secure messaging apps, ensuring user conversations are protected against potential eavesdropping or data breaches.
		listitem

			paragraph

					StaticText Enhanced Message Types
				StaticText : RCS doesn’t just improve text messaging—it redefines it with interactive elements like carousels, rich cards, and suggested action buttons. For example, businesses can create messages that include product images in a carousel format, allowing users to scroll through options without leaving the messaging app. Action buttons enable users to book appointments, make purchases, or follow links directly from the message. This level of interactivity creates a smoother, more convenient experience, enabling users to take action immediately, without having to switch to a different app or website.
