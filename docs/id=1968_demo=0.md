# Task

**User Exploration of CatenaBio's Offerings**

As a potential customer interested in innovative biotech solutions,
I understand CatenaBio's company background and scientific approach,
so that I can evaluate whether their offerings align with my needs and interests in antibody-drug conjugate technologies.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the CatenaBio homepage
When I navigate through the company's About Us, Science, and Pipeline pages
Then I should see comprehensive information about CatenaBio's mission, scientific approach, and current projects in antibody-drug conjugate technology.

	paragraph
		StaticText CatenaBio's technology is significantly differentiated from other approaches.
	paragraph
		StaticText Simplicity –
		StaticText Conventionally purified proteins can be fused under gentle, physiological reaction conditions that maintain secondary structure and enzymatic activity. The only oxidizer is the oxygen dissolved in the reaction, eliminating the need for harsh reagents and extensive reaction cleanup.
	paragraph
		StaticText Stability –
		StaticText The resulting covalent linkage between proteins is more stable than those made with maleimide chemistries.
	paragraph
		StaticText Selectivity –
		StaticText The Catenase activation step leaves active-site residues intact, resulting in highly specific conjugations of proteins at defined positions and/or orientations.
	paragraph
		StaticText Scalability –
		StaticText Partnerships with 2 large pharmaceutical companies have demonstrated gram quantity syntheses and linear scalability over a 30,000x range in production.

	heading Advantages of Our Innovative Platform
	paragraph
		StaticText CatenaBio's technology is significantly differentiated from other approaches.
	paragraph
		StaticText Simplicity –
		StaticText Conventionally purified proteins can be fused under gentle, physiological reaction conditions that maintain secondary structure and enzymatic activity. The only oxidizer is the oxygen dissolved in the reaction, eliminating the need for harsh reagents and extensive reaction cleanup.
	paragraph
		StaticText Stability –
		StaticText The resulting covalent linkage between proteins is more stable than those made with maleimide chemistries.
	paragraph
		StaticText Selectivity –
		StaticText The Catenase activation step leaves active-site residues intact, resulting in highly specific conjugations of proteins at defined positions and/or orientations.
	paragraph
		StaticText Scalability –
		StaticText Partnerships with 2 large pharmaceutical companies have demonstrated gram quantity syntheses and linear scalability over a 30,000x range in production.

**Reasoning for action:** I reasoned that accessing the Pipeline page is crucial to fulfilling the user story, as it directly addresses the requirement to understand CatenaBio's current projects. This page will likely provide insights into the latest developments and how they align with the user's interests in innovative biotech solutions, particularly in the area of antibody-drug conjugates.

**Action:** click(93) # Click on the Pipeline link to learn more about CatenaBio's current projects and developments.

**Change Description:** The browser transitioned from displaying the Science page of CatenaBio to the Pipeline page, showcasing information about CatenaBio's current projects and developments in antibody-drug conjugate technology. The page now features new headings and content related to the company's Multi-Payload Conjugate technology and lead assets, reflecting the focus on transforming antibody therapeutics.
