# Task

**Add Olive Oil to Cart**

As a culinary enthusiast,
I add premium olive oil products to my shopping cart,
so that I can easily purchase them for my upcoming cooking preparations.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the product page for Olive Oil First Harvest 2024
When I click the 'ADD' button for both Suri Romi 250ml and Suri Romi 500ml
Then I should see the cart updated to show 2 items with the correct quantities for each product.

**Reasoning for action:** I chose to click the 'ADD' button for the Suri Romi 500ml because this is one of the two olive oil products specified in the user story that need to be added to the cart. By taking this action, I move closer to fulfilling the user's goal of having both the 250ml and 500ml options in their shopping cart, which is necessary for them to easily complete their purchase.

**Action:** click('440') # Click on the 'ADD' button for Suri Romi 500ml to add it to the cart.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'ADD' button for Suri Romi 500ml, the quantity displayed updated from 1 to 2 in the cart, indicating that a second bottle was successfully added. Additionally, the state of the cart was updated to reflect the inclusion of this item.
