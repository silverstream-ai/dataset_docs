# Task

**User Story for Joining Discord Community**

As a new community member,,
I join the Discord server to engage with other users and explore community features,,
so that I can collaborate, ask questions, and gain insights from experienced developers.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the community page of Codev
When I click on the Community button and fill in my display name
Then I should be redirected to a Discord invite link and see a 'Continue' button to join the server.

		StaticText Our rapidly growing community of developers and creators building over 14,000+ apps with Codev
	heading Frequently Asked Questions
	heading What is Codev?
	StaticText +
	paragraph
		StaticText Codev is an AI-powered platform that converts text descriptions into full-stack Next.js web applications. It helps developers and non-developers alike bring their app ideas to life quickly and efficiently.
	heading How does it work?
	StaticText +
	paragraph
		StaticText Simply describe your app idea in natural language, and Codev will generate a complete Next.js application with all necessary components, styling, and functionality. The AI understands your requirements and creates production-ready code.
	heading What technologies does Codev use?
	StaticText +
	paragraph
		StaticText Codev generates applications using Next.js (a popular React framework), and Supabase (a PostgreSQL database with real-time data sync). The apps are built with best practices and are fully customizable after generation.
	heading Do I need coding experience to use Codev?
	StaticText +
	paragraph
		StaticText While coding experience is helpful, it's not required. Codev is designed to be accessible to both developers and non-developers.
	heading Can I customize the generated code?
	StaticText +
	paragraph
		StaticText Yes! The code generated by Codev is yours to modify and customize. You have full access to the source code and take it with you when you leave Codev.
	heading What are the limitations?
	StaticText +
	paragraph
		StaticText Codev can generate full-stack applications with CRUD operations and database integration. However, more complex applications like web crawlers or apps that need to handle high traffic and scalability are not currently supported. Also, we are currently only supporting web applications, and so mobile apps and Chrome extensions are not supported.
	heading Can I deploy and go to production without any developer?
	StaticText +
	paragraph
		StaticText While Codev generates production-ready code, we highly recommend having a developer review the application before going to production, particularly to address security considerations and scaling requirements. This helps ensure your application is properly secured and can handle production workloads.
	heading Can I make mobile apps (iOS/Android)?
	StaticText +
	paragraph
		StaticText No, Codev only supports making web apps at this time.

**Reasoning for action:** By clicking the Community button, I am advancing toward the goal of exploring community features on Codev. This action should lead me to a page where I can fill in my display name and access the Discord invite link, fulfilling the user story requirements.

**Action:** click(69) # Click on the Community button to explore community features.

**Change Description:** After clicking the Community button, the browser state changed from the Codev website to a Discord invitation page, where the user is invited to join the Codev community. The new page displays the number of online members, prompts the user to choose a display name, and includes buttons for continuing with registration or logging in if they already have an account.

**Reasoning for action:** By filling in the display name text box with 'SampleName', I am satisfying the requirement of providing a display name, which is necessary for the user to complete the form. This step is essential for advancing to the next action, which is to click the 'Continue' button, ultimately allowing me to join the community on Discord.

**Action:** fill(138, 'SampleName') # Fill in the display name text box with a sample name.

**Change Description:** The display name text box was filled with the sample name 'SampleName', updating its value while retaining its focus and other properties.

</details>

**Reasoning for action:** I chose to click on the 'Continue' button (identified by the ID 141) because it is necessary for progressing to join the Discord server after entering the display name. This action directly complies with the user story by facilitating the next step in the joining process, allowing me to engage with other community members as outlined in the acceptance criteria.

**Action:** click(141) # Click on the Continue button to proceed with joining the Discord server.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'Continue' button, the browser transitioned to a loading state, prompting the user with a CAPTCHA modal that requires them to confirm they are not a robot before proceeding further; the previously interactive button is now labeled 'Loading'.
