# Task

**Exploring AI Management Features and Performance Insights**

As a property management professional,
I understand how to manage and monitor AI performance,
so that I can effectively leverage AI tools to optimize my property management operations.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the How it Works page of the Haven platform
When I select the Manage AI Model tab and then the Monitor AI Performance and Activity tab
Then I should see detailed descriptions of how to control the AI's functionality and view performance insights for tracking across properties.

**Reasoning for action:** By clicking the 'Manage AI Model' tab, I navigate closer to the section where I can learn about managing AI functionalities.

**Reasoning for action:** I clicked on the 'Monitor AI Performance and Activity' tab because it directly targets the user's intent to understand and control AI performance in property management. By selecting this tab, I expected to access specific functionality regarding the AI's activity monitoring, thereby allowing the user to effectively leverage AI tools as outlined in their goals.

**Action:** click(139) # Click on the 'Monitor AI Performance and Activity' tab to explore AI performance insights.

**Change Description:** After clicking on the 'Monitor AI Performance and Activity' tab, the browser updated to display the 'Monitor AI Performance and Activity' panel, which includes a new description indicating that users can track their AI's activity and performance across properties using a single dashboard.
