# Task

**User Exploration of Hair Transplant Options**

As a a potential patient seeking hair restoration solutions,
I explore different hair transplant options and their associated costs,
so that I can make an informed decision about the best treatment for my needs.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Try Mable website and want to explore hair restoration
When I click on the 'Before And After' link and view the results related to hair restoration, followed by exploring the 'Transplant Types' and then the 'Cost' link
Then I should see a page displaying various hair transplant options and then the detailed pricing for each type of hair transplant.

		paragraph
			StaticText Mable’s core offering is an innovative platform that blends genomics with telemedicine. The platform collected and analysed patients’ genetic and biomarker data, generating insights that inform individualized treatment plans. For migraine sufferers, who often face unpredictable symptoms and inconsistent treatment responses, this personalized approach offered the potential for more effective and targeted care.

			StaticText affecting millions globally. Traditional approaches to migraine management often rely on a trial-and-error method of prescribing medications, which can take time and may not yield optimal results. Mable aims to address this challenge by utilizing genomics to better understand a patient’s predisposition to migraines and how their body is likely to respond to various treatments.
		paragraph

		heading How the Platform Works
		heading ​
		paragraph
			StaticText Mable’s platform offers an entirely virtual experience, from consultations to diagnostics and treatment planning. Patients seeking care for migraines begin their journey with an online consultation, during which they share their medical history and symptoms. From there, Mable offers DNA testing services to gain insights into their genetic makeup.

		paragraph
			StaticText By analysing genetic markers and biomarkers, Mable provides precision medicine options, offering treatments specifically tailored to the individual patient’s biological profile. This form of preventive care not only helps treat current symptoms but also aims to reduce the frequency and intensity of future migraines. Patients receive ongoing telehealth support to adjust treatments as necessary, based on their progress and changes in their condition.

		heading ​
		paragraph
			StaticText The use of genomics in healthcare, and particularly in migraine management, represents a shift toward precision medicine—a medical model that customizes healthcare, with decisions and treatments tailored to the individual patient. For migraine patients, this means that instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, Mable provides treatments that align with each patient’s unique genetic and biological characteristics.
		paragraph
			StaticText ​
		paragraph
			StaticText This type of personalised care is particularly valuable in the treatment of neurological conditions like migraines, which often involve a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. By identifying the genetic underpinnings of a patient’s migraine condition, Mable can recommend treatments that are more likely to be effective based on their genetic profile, potentially improving outcomes and reducing the side effects of unnecessary medications.

			StaticText Real Patient Results: Before and After Comparisons
		paragraph
			StaticText ​
		paragraph
			StaticText When considering a
			link hair transplant, url='https://www.my-hair.uk/'
			StaticText , one of the most compelling factors for prospective patients is the tangible evidence of successful outcomes. Seeing the results from previous patients can provide valuable insight into the effectiveness of the procedure and the kind of transformation one can expect. At My Hair UK, we pride ourselves on offering advanced hair transplant techniques with exceptional results, and in this article, we will explore the journey of hair restoration, illustrating the before and after results of hair transplants, the processes involved, and what you can expect as you consider this life-changing option.

		heading Understanding Hair Loss: The Background​
		heading ​
		paragraph
			StaticText Before diving into the specifics of hair transplant results, it is essential to understand the underlying causes of hair loss. Hair loss can stem from a variety of factors, including genetics, hormonal changes, medical conditions, and environmental factors. The two most common types of hair loss that patients experience are androgenetic alopecia (commonly known as male or female pattern baldness) and
			link telogen effluvium, url='https://www.my-hair.uk/guides/telogen-effluvium'
			StaticText , a temporary condition often triggered by stress or hormonal changes.
		paragraph
			StaticText Androgenetic alopecia is characterized by a gradual thinning of hair and a receding hairline, leading to bald patches on the scalp. This type of hair loss is hereditary, which means that if you have a family history of baldness, you may also be at risk. On the other hand, telogen effluvium causes hair to fall out in larger amounts due to the hair growth cycle being disrupted, often resulting in noticeable thinning across the scalp but may be temporary.
		paragraph
			StaticText Recognizing the specific type of hair loss you are experiencing is critical, as it directly influences the treatment plan we at My Hair UK will recommend. A thorough consultation with one of our experienced hair restoration specialists will help determine the best course of action tailored to your unique needs.
		paragraph

		heading What Is a Hair Transplant?
		heading ​
		paragraph
			StaticText A hair transplant is a surgical procedure that involves relocating hair follicles from a donor area—usually the back or sides of the scalp—where hair is abundant to areas of thinning or baldness. The two primary methods of hair transplantation are
			link Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE), url='https://www.my-hair.uk/fue-hair-transplant'
			StaticText and Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT), though we will focus solely on FUE. The FUE method is renowned for its minimally invasive nature, reduced recovery time, and natural-looking results.
		paragraph
			StaticText During an FUE procedure, individual follicular units are extracted using a specialized device that ensures minimal scarring and damage to the surrounding tissues. These harvested follicles are then meticulously implanted into the recipient area, following a strategic pattern that aligns with your natural hair growth direction. The result is a seamless, natural appearance that integrates well with your existing hair.
		paragraph
			StaticText ​
		heading Before the Hair Transplant: What to Expect
		heading ​
		paragraph
			StaticText Before undergoing a hair transplant at My Hair UK, patients can expect a thorough assessment process. This includes a detailed consultation where our doctors will discuss your medical history, evaluate the extent of hair loss, and set realistic expectations regarding the results, and discuss exactly what the
			link hair transplant cost, url='https://www.my-hair.uk/hair-transplant-cost'
			StaticText will be for your needs. Photographic documentation of your hair before the procedure is also conducted. This serves as a baseline to compare against the results post-surgery.
		paragraph
			StaticText Prior to the transplant, you may be advised to avoid certain medications that can thin the blood, such as aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs, for a period of time leading up to the procedure. This is to minimize any potential bleeding during surgery. Our team will provide you with a pre-operative checklist, ensuring you are well-prepared for the day of the procedure.

			StaticText The initial results from a hair transplant may not be immediately visible. In fact, it is typical for transplanted hair to shed within the first few weeks post-procedure. This can be disconcerting for some patients, but it is important to understand that this is a normal part of the hair growth cycle. The hair follicles remain intact, and new growth will typically begin within three to four months after the transplant.

				StaticText I had my surgery with Dr Munir at the clinic on Deansgate to sort my hair line, it's now been about 7 months and glad to report I'm seeing a really good growth of the new hair. Not a lot happened for the first few months (they tell you to expect this but it's hard not to stress until you see some results!) the new hair is blending in nicely with the old hair and filling out really well. Overall I'm really pleased, in and out same day and a very professional service all round.

				StaticText Its just come up to a year since my transplant at the Harrow clinic with Dr Shuaib in December 2023 and I've just sent them my 12 month results pictures and it's night and day different, from having a badly receded front hairline it's now back to where it was in my 20s in the shape I wanted. So pleased with the results from such a simple operation, very glad I did it and I'd recommend the clinic to anyone

				StaticText It's been around 9 months since my procedure at the beginning of the year at the clinic in Harrow, and looking back at my old pictures the difference is night and day, such a massive improvement in my hair thickness in my crown area, the bald patch has gone and it seems improves a bit further every month. Dr Shuaib has done a great job with it, If anyone is thinking of getting theirs done I'd highly recommend this place, the price was sensible and the results have been well worth it!

				StaticText I had my hairline done 2 weeks ago in Manchester with Dr Munir after my frend has fantastic results with them from his transplant last year. It's a little early to talk about final results yet and I'll update this once they are through, but very pleased with everything so far, I had about 1500 grafts and they procedure went so fast, after a long chat with the doctor to get the hairline position exactly where I wanted it. everything went really well. They were really friendly at the clinic and Daniel has been on hand answering any questions afterwards on whatsapp. The swelling went after a few days and all my little scabs had healed by about the 8th day. It's early but I'm already pleased I've got it sorted finally and I know how much better it's going to look in the photos for my wedding next summer.

				StaticText I had a 2800 graft procedure with Dr Mir in March, now 6 months down the line and I'm seeing some really good growth - it definitely took a few months before I started seeing the first hairs come through which was just as expected, then it's just got thicker and thicker. The hairline is just where I asked for and I'm getting so many positive comments from friends, it's made such a big improvement. Overall I'm very pleased with the results at this stage and theres plenty more growth to come I'm told, friendly clinic and doctor, good advice and easy to book in and follow up with.

				StaticText This was the 2nd hair transplant I've had, after one in Turkey a couple of years back, and what a difference - both in the way I was treated and the results. My surgery day was relaxed and pleasant with the nurses really looking after me all day and chatting to me during the procedure, even getting me food in at lunchtime. The recovery time was quick - around 8 days till my scabs had all come off and the head fully healed, and I'm now on month 6 and have really strong growth, already more than I saw in a year after my first procedure, I'm starting to suspect the Turkish clinic I originally went to put a lot less grafts in than they promised. It was so much less hassle getting everything done in London, and a much smaller difference in price than I was expecting, wish I'd stayed in the UK for my first one and used this company instead, big thank you to Dr Mir and all at the clinic for their good work.

				StaticText its now 6 months since my transplant at the Manchester clinic - I had 2800 hair grafts with Dr Munir, and it's looking great, I will admit to being a little worried when not much came through in the first 3 months but this was what I was told to expect, and then right on time in month 4 the first of the new baby hairs started appearing, a couple of months on they are coming through strongly already and seem to be improving every week, just in time for the summer. Apparently it's about a year before the final result but it's already such a big improvement and it's been well worth doing, I'd recommend them to anyone who isn't happy with their hair.

				StaticText My transplant took around 6 hours at the Manchester clinic back in January with Dr Munir. Nice place with friendly staff and as I fell asleep during the operation for a couple of hours in the afternoon my surgery was done before I knew it. Other than a little pain fron the anaesthetic injections at the beginning the rest of the day was comfortable and pain free (hence the sleeping!) and recovery downtime was about 10 days. Fast forward 6 months and so much has changed - the new hairline started coming through on month 3 and has slowly been getting thicker and thicker, I'm really pleased its coming through just in time for summer as it's definitely improved my appearance. Overally really pleased I went with the My Hair UK clinic, they've done a great job.

				StaticText I completed my beard transplant in January with Dr Munir and his team at the Deansgate clinic, and after 6 months of growth I can safely say my beard is looking a million times better than it used to, all the patchy areas are filled and the upper beard line is exactly where I wanted it. It was always so frustrating not being able to grow it how I wanted, I'd already tried derma rollering and also minoxidil, but neither made much difference, and the transplant has drastically improved how it looks, highly recommended!

				StaticText I have no hesitation in recommending this place - they have done fantastic work with my new hair. Everyone has been great to deal with and Dr Mir the surgeon was really approachable and friendly. It's 7 months since my surgery and just had a follow up consultation to make sure it's all on track and the hair regrowth has been exactly what I wanted, they are definitely worth speaking to if you are looking for a transplant in the UK that isn't silly money.

				StaticText After having my transplant a month ago with the My Hair clinic in Harrow the overriding impression I was left with was what an easy place to deal with. Every step from my consultation to the surgery day itself and aftercare have all been simple and stress free to arrange, my surgery was done when I wanted and I got exactly the hairline position I had discussed with the doctor beforehand. The day went smoothly, and apart from the anaesthetic injections at the beginning which I was warned would be a little uncomfortable for 5 mins the whole resto of the day was pain free, I even fell asleep for a few hours in the afternoon while Dr Mir did the operation. the healing process afterwards took around a week which was no problem as I just worked from home, there was a little redness as expected for a few more weeks, now it's the just wait for the final results to come through. I'll update this further once I have the full results but so far everything has been first rate.

				StaticText Its coming up 9 months since my transplant last October and I'm very pleased to report the new hair growth has been fantastic - not much happened for the first 3 months after surgery which was as expected & I had the minor panic when the first hairs shed after a month but I was told in advance it was part of the growth process, then around month 4 new baby hairs started to appear, and it's just got thicker and thicker since then. I now have a great new hairline which looks even better than it did when I was younger and it's still improving. I have recommended a couple of family members to the clinic as they have done such a good job with mine, if you're considering getting a transplant then all I can say is I wish I'd done it a long time ago rather than putting up with embarrasing receding hair.

				StaticText It took a while to get around to booking my transplant, and now wish I'd done it years ago! The day itself went really smoothly, pain free and the clinic staff were really friendly and I was relaxed straight away. 6 months on and my new hairline is in the perfect position, it's knocked years off how old I look and I'm really looking forward to summer without a baseball cap to hide my head for the first time in ages. Great job all round and delighted with the results.

				StaticText Considering this surgery has made such a big difference for me this was really straightfoward to arrange. All the staff were really helpful and have been easy to contact for follow ups and aftercare advice. Dr Munir was friendly and the surgery day itself went really smoothly. A week or so recovery time and following that it's just been waiting for the new hairs to grow through, which does seem like forever at the time, but 6 months down the line and I've got lots of new growth and a hairline that makes me look a lot younger which is exactly what I wanted. Great result and still lots more to come - I definitley recommend this place to anyone thinking about a transplant.

			StaticText Real Patient Results: Before and After Comparisons
		paragraph
			StaticText ​
		paragraph
			StaticText When considering a
			link hair transplant, url='https://www.my-hair.uk/'
			StaticText , one of the most compelling factors for prospective patients is the tangible evidence of successful outcomes. Seeing the results from previous patients can provide valuable insight into the effectiveness of the procedure and the kind of transformation one can expect. At My Hair UK, we pride ourselves on offering advanced hair transplant techniques with exceptional results, and in this article, we will explore the journey of hair restoration, illustrating the before and after results of hair transplants, the processes involved, and what you can expect as you consider this life-changing option.

		heading Understanding Hair Loss: The Background​
		heading ​
		paragraph
			StaticText Before diving into the specifics of hair transplant results, it is essential to understand the underlying causes of hair loss. Hair loss can stem from a variety of factors, including genetics, hormonal changes, medical conditions, and environmental factors. The two most common types of hair loss that patients experience are androgenetic alopecia (commonly known as male or female pattern baldness) and
			link telogen effluvium, url='https://www.my-hair.uk/guides/telogen-effluvium'
			StaticText , a temporary condition often triggered by stress or hormonal changes.
		paragraph
			StaticText Androgenetic alopecia is characterized by a gradual thinning of hair and a receding hairline, leading to bald patches on the scalp. This type of hair loss is hereditary, which means that if you have a family history of baldness, you may also be at risk. On the other hand, telogen effluvium causes hair to fall out in larger amounts due to the hair growth cycle being disrupted, often resulting in noticeable thinning across the scalp but may be temporary.
		paragraph
			StaticText Recognizing the specific type of hair loss you are experiencing is critical, as it directly influences the treatment plan we at My Hair UK will recommend. A thorough consultation with one of our experienced hair restoration specialists will help determine the best course of action tailored to your unique needs.
		paragraph

		heading What Is a Hair Transplant?
		heading ​
		paragraph
			StaticText A hair transplant is a surgical procedure that involves relocating hair follicles from a donor area—usually the back or sides of the scalp—where hair is abundant to areas of thinning or baldness. The two primary methods of hair transplantation are
			link Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE), url='https://www.my-hair.uk/fue-hair-transplant'
			StaticText and Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT), though we will focus solely on FUE. The FUE method is renowned for its minimally invasive nature, reduced recovery time, and natural-looking results.
		paragraph
			StaticText During an FUE procedure, individual follicular units are extracted using a specialized device that ensures minimal scarring and damage to the surrounding tissues. These harvested follicles are then meticulously implanted into the recipient area, following a strategic pattern that aligns with your natural hair growth direction. The result is a seamless, natural appearance that integrates well with your existing hair.
		paragraph
			StaticText ​
		heading Before the Hair Transplant: What to Expect
		heading ​
		paragraph
			StaticText Before undergoing a hair transplant at My Hair UK, patients can expect a thorough assessment process. This includes a detailed consultation where our doctors will discuss your medical history, evaluate the extent of hair loss, and set realistic expectations regarding the results, and discuss exactly what the
			link hair transplant cost, url='https://www.my-hair.uk/hair-transplant-cost'
			StaticText will be for your needs. Photographic documentation of your hair before the procedure is also conducted. This serves as a baseline to compare against the results post-surgery.
		paragraph
			StaticText Prior to the transplant, you may be advised to avoid certain medications that can thin the blood, such as aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs, for a period of time leading up to the procedure. This is to minimize any potential bleeding during surgery. Our team will provide you with a pre-operative checklist, ensuring you are well-prepared for the day of the procedure.

		heading After the Hair Transplant: Understanding Results
		paragraph
		paragraph
			StaticText The initial results from a hair transplant may not be immediately visible. In fact, it is typical for transplanted hair to shed within the first few weeks post-procedure. This can be disconcerting for some patients, but it is important to understand that this is a normal part of the hair growth cycle. The hair follicles remain intact, and new growth will typically begin within three to four months after the transplant.

				StaticText I had my surgery with Dr Munir at the clinic on Deansgate to sort my hair line, it's now been about 7 months and glad to report I'm seeing a really good growth of the new hair. Not a lot happened for the first few months (they tell you to expect this but it's hard not to stress until you see some results!) the new hair is blending in nicely with the old hair and filling out really well. Overall I'm really pleased, in and out same day and a very professional service all round.

				StaticText Its just come up to a year since my transplant at the Harrow clinic with Dr Shuaib in December 2023 and I've just sent them my 12 month results pictures and it's night and day different, from having a badly receded front hairline it's now back to where it was in my 20s in the shape I wanted. So pleased with the results from such a simple operation, very glad I did it and I'd recommend the clinic to anyone

				StaticText It's been around 9 months since my procedure at the beginning of the year at the clinic in Harrow, and looking back at my old pictures the difference is night and day, such a massive improvement in my hair thickness in my crown area, the bald patch has gone and it seems improves a bit further every month. Dr Shuaib has done a great job with it, If anyone is thinking of getting theirs done I'd highly recommend this place, the price was sensible and the results have been well worth it!

				StaticText I had my hairline done 2 weeks ago in Manchester with Dr Munir after my frend has fantastic results with them from his transplant last year. It's a little early to talk about final results yet and I'll update this once they are through, but very pleased with everything so far, I had about 1500 grafts and they procedure went so fast, after a long chat with the doctor to get the hairline position exactly where I wanted it. everything went really well. They were really friendly at the clinic and Daniel has been on hand answering any questions afterwards on whatsapp. The swelling went after a few days and all my little scabs had healed by about the 8th day. It's early but I'm already pleased I've got it sorted finally and I know how much better it's going to look in the photos for my wedding next summer.

				StaticText I had a 2800 graft procedure with Dr Mir in March, now 6 months down the line and I'm seeing some really good growth - it definitely took a few months before I started seeing the first hairs come through which was just as expected, then it's just got thicker and thicker. The hairline is just where I asked for and I'm getting so many positive comments from friends, it's made such a big improvement. Overall I'm very pleased with the results at this stage and theres plenty more growth to come I'm told, friendly clinic and doctor, good advice and easy to book in and follow up with.

				StaticText This was the 2nd hair transplant I've had, after one in Turkey a couple of years back, and what a difference - both in the way I was treated and the results. My surgery day was relaxed and pleasant with the nurses really looking after me all day and chatting to me during the procedure, even getting me food in at lunchtime. The recovery time was quick - around 8 days till my scabs had all come off and the head fully healed, and I'm now on month 6 and have really strong growth, already more than I saw in a year after my first procedure, I'm starting to suspect the Turkish clinic I originally went to put a lot less grafts in than they promised. It was so much less hassle getting everything done in London, and a much smaller difference in price than I was expecting, wish I'd stayed in the UK for my first one and used this company instead, big thank you to Dr Mir and all at the clinic for their good work.

				StaticText its now 6 months since my transplant at the Manchester clinic - I had 2800 hair grafts with Dr Munir, and it's looking great, I will admit to being a little worried when not much came through in the first 3 months but this was what I was told to expect, and then right on time in month 4 the first of the new baby hairs started appearing, a couple of months on they are coming through strongly already and seem to be improving every week, just in time for the summer. Apparently it's about a year before the final result but it's already such a big improvement and it's been well worth doing, I'd recommend them to anyone who isn't happy with their hair.

				StaticText My transplant took around 6 hours at the Manchester clinic back in January with Dr Munir. Nice place with friendly staff and as I fell asleep during the operation for a couple of hours in the afternoon my surgery was done before I knew it. Other than a little pain fron the anaesthetic injections at the beginning the rest of the day was comfortable and pain free (hence the sleeping!) and recovery downtime was about 10 days. Fast forward 6 months and so much has changed - the new hairline started coming through on month 3 and has slowly been getting thicker and thicker, I'm really pleased its coming through just in time for summer as it's definitely improved my appearance. Overally really pleased I went with the My Hair UK clinic, they've done a great job.

				StaticText I completed my beard transplant in January with Dr Munir and his team at the Deansgate clinic, and after 6 months of growth I can safely say my beard is looking a million times better than it used to, all the patchy areas are filled and the upper beard line is exactly where I wanted it. It was always so frustrating not being able to grow it how I wanted, I'd already tried derma rollering and also minoxidil, but neither made much difference, and the transplant has drastically improved how it looks, highly recommended!

				StaticText After having my transplant a month ago with the My Hair clinic in Harrow the overriding impression I was left with was what an easy place to deal with. Every step from my consultation to the surgery day itself and aftercare have all been simple and stress free to arrange, my surgery was done when I wanted and I got exactly the hairline position I had discussed with the doctor beforehand. The day went smoothly, and apart from the anaesthetic injections at the beginning which I was warned would be a little uncomfortable for 5 mins the whole resto of the day was pain free, I even fell asleep for a few hours in the afternoon while Dr Mir did the operation. the healing process afterwards took around a week which was no problem as I just worked from home, there was a little redness as expected for a few more weeks, now it's the just wait for the final results to come through. I'll update this further once I have the full results but so far everything has been first rate.

				StaticText Its coming up 9 months since my transplant last October and I'm very pleased to report the new hair growth has been fantastic - not much happened for the first 3 months after surgery which was as expected & I had the minor panic when the first hairs shed after a month but I was told in advance it was part of the growth process, then around month 4 new baby hairs started to appear, and it's just got thicker and thicker since then. I now have a great new hairline which looks even better than it did when I was younger and it's still improving. I have recommended a couple of family members to the clinic as they have done such a good job with mine, if you're considering getting a transplant then all I can say is I wish I'd done it a long time ago rather than putting up with embarrasing receding hair.

Great job all round and delighted with the results.

				StaticText Considering this surgery has made such a big difference for me this was really straightfoward to arrange. All the staff were really helpful and have been easy to contact for follow ups and aftercare advice. Dr Munir was friendly and the surgery day itself went really smoothly. A week or so recovery time and following that it's just been waiting for the new hairs to grow through, which does seem like forever at the time, but 6 months down the line and I've got lots of new growth and a hairline that makes me look a lot younger which is exactly what I wanted. Great result and still lots more to come - I definitley recommend this place to anyone thinking about a transplant.

		paragraph
			StaticText When considering a
			link hair transplant, url='https://www.my-hair.uk/'
			StaticText , one of the most compelling factors for prospective patients is the tangible evidence of successful outcomes. Seeing the results from previous patients can provide valuable insight into the effectiveness of the procedure and the kind of transformation one can expect. At My Hair UK, we pride ourselves on offering advanced hair transplant techniques with exceptional results, and in this article, we will explore the journey of hair restoration, illustrating the before and after results of hair transplants, the processes involved, and what you can expect as you consider this life-changing option.

		heading Understanding Hair Loss: The Background​
		heading ​
		paragraph
			StaticText Before diving into the specifics of hair transplant results, it is essential to understand the underlying causes of hair loss. Hair loss can stem from a variety of factors, including genetics, hormonal changes, medical conditions, and environmental factors. The two most common types of hair loss that patients experience are androgenetic alopecia (commonly known as male or female pattern baldness) and
			link telogen effluvium, url='https://www.my-hair.uk/guides/telogen-effluvium'
			StaticText , a temporary condition often triggered by stress or hormonal changes.
		paragraph
			StaticText Androgenetic alopecia is characterized by a gradual thinning of hair and a receding hairline, leading to bald patches on the scalp. This type of hair loss is hereditary, which means that if you have a family history of baldness, you may also be at risk. On the other hand, telogen effluvium causes hair to fall out in larger amounts due to the hair growth cycle being disrupted, often resulting in noticeable thinning across the scalp but may be temporary.
		paragraph
			StaticText Recognizing the specific type of hair loss you are experiencing is critical, as it directly influences the treatment plan we at My Hair UK will recommend. A thorough consultation with one of our experienced hair restoration specialists will help determine the best course of action tailored to your unique needs.
		paragraph

		heading What Is a Hair Transplant?
		heading ​
		paragraph
			StaticText A hair transplant is a surgical procedure that involves relocating hair follicles from a donor area—usually the back or sides of the scalp—where hair is abundant to areas of thinning or baldness. The two primary methods of hair transplantation are
			link Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE), url='https://www.my-hair.uk/fue-hair-transplant'
			StaticText and Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT), though we will focus solely on FUE. The FUE method is renowned for its minimally invasive nature, reduced recovery time, and natural-looking results.
		paragraph
			StaticText During an FUE procedure, individual follicular units are extracted using a specialized device that ensures minimal scarring and damage to the surrounding tissues. These harvested follicles are then meticulously implanted into the recipient area, following a strategic pattern that aligns with your natural hair growth direction. The result is a seamless, natural appearance that integrates well with your existing hair.
		paragraph
			StaticText ​
		heading Before the Hair Transplant: What to Expect
		heading ​
		paragraph
			StaticText Before undergoing a hair transplant at My Hair UK, patients can expect a thorough assessment process. This includes a detailed consultation where our doctors will discuss your medical history, evaluate the extent of hair loss, and set realistic expectations regarding the results, and discuss exactly what the
			link hair transplant cost, url='https://www.my-hair.uk/hair-transplant-cost'
			StaticText will be for your needs. Photographic documentation of your hair before the procedure is also conducted. This serves as a baseline to compare against the results post-surgery.
		paragraph
			StaticText Prior to the transplant, you may be advised to avoid certain medications that can thin the blood, such as aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs, for a period of time leading up to the procedure. This is to minimize any potential bleeding during surgery. Our team will provide you with a pre-operative checklist, ensuring you are well-prepared for the day of the procedure.
		paragraph

		heading After the Hair Transplant: Understanding Results
		paragraph
		paragraph
			StaticText The initial results from a hair transplant may not be immediately visible. In fact, it is typical for transplanted hair to shed within the first few weeks post-procedure. This can be disconcerting for some patients, but it is important to understand that this is a normal part of the hair growth cycle. The hair follicles remain intact, and new growth will typically begin within three to four months after the transplant.

		heading Hair Growth Timeline
		list

				paragraph
					StaticText Weeks 1-2
					StaticText : Immediately after the procedure, you will notice some redness and swelling in the recipient area. Transplanted hairs may begin to shed, which is completely normal.
			listitem
				ListMarker 0.
				paragraph
					StaticText Months 1-3
					StaticText : New hair growth will start to emerge, often appearing fine and lighter in colour than surrounding hair. This early growth may seem sparse, but it signifies that the follicles are beginning to regenerate.
			listitem
				ListMarker 0.
				paragraph
					StaticText Months 4-6
					StaticText : Hair will continue to thicken and become more noticeable. Many patients begin to feel more confident as they see the transplanted hair blend seamlessly with their existing hair.
			listitem
				ListMarker 0.
				paragraph
					StaticText Months 6-12
					StaticText : At this stage, patients typically experience significant hair growth. The transplanted hair should now match the texture and colour of your natural hair. By the end of the first year, you can expect to see the full results of your hair transplant.

			StaticText It is not uncommon for potential patients to have concerns or misconceptions about hair transplants. Here are some common myths debunked:
		paragraph
			StaticText Myth
			StaticText : Hair transplants are only for men.
			StaticText Fact
			StaticText : Women can also benefit significantly from hair transplants, especially those experiencing thinning due to genetic factors or conditions such as traction alopecia.
		paragraph
			StaticText Myth
			StaticText : Transplanted hair will look unnatural.
			StaticText Fact
			StaticText : When performed by experienced professionals, hair transplants yield natural-looking results. The FUE technique allows for precise placement of follicles, mimicking natural growth patterns.
		paragraph
			StaticText Myth
			StaticText : Hair transplants are painful.
			StaticText Fact
			StaticText : Most patients experience minimal discomfort during and after the procedure, thanks to local anaesthesia. Recovery times are generally short, with many patients returning to normal activities within a few days.

				StaticText I had my surgery with Dr Munir at the clinic on Deansgate to sort my hair line, it's now been about 7 months and glad to report I'm seeing a really good growth of the new hair. Not a lot happened for the first few months (they tell you to expect this but it's hard not to stress until you see some results!) the new hair is blending in nicely with the old hair and filling out really well. Overall I'm really pleased, in and out same day and a very professional service all round.

				StaticText Its just come up to a year since my transplant at the Harrow clinic with Dr Shuaib in December 2023 and I've just sent them my 12 month results pictures and it's night and day different, from having a badly receded front hairline it's now back to where it was in my 20s in the shape I wanted. So pleased with the results from such a simple operation, very glad I did it and I'd recommend the clinic to anyone

Dr Shuaib has done a great job with it, If anyone is thinking of getting theirs done I'd highly recommend this place, the price was sensible and the results have been well worth it!

				StaticText I had my hairline done 2 weeks ago in Manchester with Dr Munir after my frend has fantastic results with them from his transplant last year. It's a little early to talk about final results yet and I'll update this once they are through, but very pleased with everything so far, I had about 1500 grafts and they procedure went so fast, after a long chat with the doctor to get the hairline position exactly where I wanted it. everything went really well. They were really friendly at the clinic and Daniel has been on hand answering any questions afterwards on whatsapp. The swelling went after a few days and all my little scabs had healed by about the 8th day. It's early but I'm already pleased I've got it sorted finally and I know how much better it's going to look in the photos for my wedding next summer.

				StaticText I had a 2800 graft procedure with Dr Mir in March, now 6 months down the line and I'm seeing some really good growth - it definitely took a few months before I started seeing the first hairs come through which was just as expected, then it's just got thicker and thicker. The hairline is just where I asked for and I'm getting so many positive comments from friends, it's made such a big improvement. Overall I'm very pleased with the results at this stage and theres plenty more growth to come I'm told, friendly clinic and doctor, good advice and easy to book in and follow up with.

				StaticText This was the 2nd hair transplant I've had, after one in Turkey a couple of years back, and what a difference - both in the way I was treated and the results. My surgery day was relaxed and pleasant with the nurses really looking after me all day and chatting to me during the procedure, even getting me food in at lunchtime. The recovery time was quick - around 8 days till my scabs had all come off and the head fully healed, and I'm now on month 6 and have really strong growth, already more than I saw in a year after my first procedure, I'm starting to suspect the Turkish clinic I originally went to put a lot less grafts in than they promised. It was so much less hassle getting everything done in London, and a much smaller difference in price than I was expecting, wish I'd stayed in the UK for my first one and used this company instead, big thank you to Dr Mir and all at the clinic for their good work.

				StaticText its now 6 months since my transplant at the Manchester clinic - I had 2800 hair grafts with Dr Munir, and it's looking great, I will admit to being a little worried when not much came through in the first 3 months but this was what I was told to expect, and then right on time in month 4 the first of the new baby hairs started appearing, a couple of months on they are coming through strongly already and seem to be improving every week, just in time for the summer. Apparently it's about a year before the final result but it's already such a big improvement and it's been well worth doing, I'd recommend them to anyone who isn't happy with their hair.

				StaticText My transplant took around 6 hours at the Manchester clinic back in January with Dr Munir. Nice place with friendly staff and as I fell asleep during the operation for a couple of hours in the afternoon my surgery was done before I knew it. Other than a little pain fron the anaesthetic injections at the beginning the rest of the day was comfortable and pain free (hence the sleeping!) and recovery downtime was about 10 days. Fast forward 6 months and so much has changed - the new hairline started coming through on month 3 and has slowly been getting thicker and thicker, I'm really pleased its coming through just in time for summer as it's definitely improved my appearance. Overally really pleased I went with the My Hair UK clinic, they've done a great job.

				StaticText I completed my beard transplant in January with Dr Munir and his team at the Deansgate clinic, and after 6 months of growth I can safely say my beard is looking a million times better than it used to, all the patchy areas are filled and the upper beard line is exactly where I wanted it. It was always so frustrating not being able to grow it how I wanted, I'd already tried derma rollering and also minoxidil, but neither made much difference, and the transplant has drastically improved how it looks, highly recommended!

				StaticText After having my transplant a month ago with the My Hair clinic in Harrow the overriding impression I was left with was what an easy place to deal with. Every step from my consultation to the surgery day itself and aftercare have all been simple and stress free to arrange, my surgery was done when I wanted and I got exactly the hairline position I had discussed with the doctor beforehand. The day went smoothly, and apart from the anaesthetic injections at the beginning which I was warned would be a little uncomfortable for 5 mins the whole resto of the day was pain free, I even fell asleep for a few hours in the afternoon while Dr Mir did the operation. the healing process afterwards took around a week which was no problem as I just worked from home, there was a little redness as expected for a few more weeks, now it's the just wait for the final results to come through. I'll update this further once I have the full results but so far everything has been first rate.

				StaticText Its coming up 9 months since my transplant last October and I'm very pleased to report the new hair growth has been fantastic - not much happened for the first 3 months after surgery which was as expected & I had the minor panic when the first hairs shed after a month but I was told in advance it was part of the growth process, then around month 4 new baby hairs started to appear, and it's just got thicker and thicker since then. I now have a great new hairline which looks even better than it did when I was younger and it's still improving. I have recommended a couple of family members to the clinic as they have done such a good job with mine, if you're considering getting a transplant then all I can say is I wish I'd done it a long time ago rather than putting up with embarrasing receding hair.

**Reasoning for action:** I chose to click on the 'Transplant Types' link because it directly fulfills the requirement of exploring different hair transplant options. This step is essential for the user to gather information on various procedures available, which aligns with their goal of making an informed decision about hair restoration solutions. By taking this action, I ensure the user can access the necessary details related to specific transplant methods.

**Action:** click(149) # Click on the 'Transplant Types' link to explore different types of hair transplants available.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'Transplant Types' link, the browser navigated to a section displaying various hair transplant options, including specific links for FUE, FUT, Afro Hair Transplant, and others, thus updating the navigation structure to reflect these new choices.

			StaticText Real Patient Results: Before and After Comparisons
		paragraph
			StaticText ​
		paragraph
			StaticText When considering a
			link hair transplant, url='https://www.my-hair.uk/'
			StaticText , one of the most compelling factors for prospective patients is the tangible evidence of successful outcomes. Seeing the results from previous patients can provide valuable insight into the effectiveness of the procedure and the kind of transformation one can expect. At My Hair UK, we pride ourselves on offering advanced hair transplant techniques with exceptional results, and in this article, we will explore the journey of hair restoration, illustrating the before and after results of hair transplants, the processes involved, and what you can expect as you consider this life-changing option.

		heading Understanding Hair Loss: The Background​
		heading ​
		paragraph
			StaticText Before diving into the specifics of hair transplant results, it is essential to understand the underlying causes of hair loss. Hair loss can stem from a variety of factors, including genetics, hormonal changes, medical conditions, and environmental factors. The two most common types of hair loss that patients experience are androgenetic alopecia (commonly known as male or female pattern baldness) and
			link telogen effluvium, url='https://www.my-hair.uk/guides/telogen-effluvium'
			StaticText , a temporary condition often triggered by stress or hormonal changes.
		paragraph
			StaticText Androgenetic alopecia is characterized by a gradual thinning of hair and a receding hairline, leading to bald patches on the scalp. This type of hair loss is hereditary, which means that if you have a family history of baldness, you may also be at risk. On the other hand, telogen effluvium causes hair to fall out in larger amounts due to the hair growth cycle being disrupted, often resulting in noticeable thinning across the scalp but may be temporary.
		paragraph
			StaticText Recognizing the specific type of hair loss you are experiencing is critical, as it directly influences the treatment plan we at My Hair UK will recommend. A thorough consultation with one of our experienced hair restoration specialists will help determine the best course of action tailored to your unique needs.
		paragraph

		heading What Is a Hair Transplant?
		heading ​
		paragraph
			StaticText A hair transplant is a surgical procedure that involves relocating hair follicles from a donor area—usually the back or sides of the scalp—where hair is abundant to areas of thinning or baldness. The two primary methods of hair transplantation are
			link Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE), url='https://www.my-hair.uk/fue-hair-transplant'
			StaticText and Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT), though we will focus solely on FUE. The FUE method is renowned for its minimally invasive nature, reduced recovery time, and natural-looking results.
		paragraph
			StaticText During an FUE procedure, individual follicular units are extracted using a specialized device that ensures minimal scarring and damage to the surrounding tissues. These harvested follicles are then meticulously implanted into the recipient area, following a strategic pattern that aligns with your natural hair growth direction. The result is a seamless, natural appearance that integrates well with your existing hair.
		paragraph
			StaticText ​
		heading Before the Hair Transplant: What to Expect
		heading ​
		paragraph
			StaticText Before undergoing a hair transplant at My Hair UK, patients can expect a thorough assessment process. This includes a detailed consultation where our doctors will discuss your medical history, evaluate the extent of hair loss, and set realistic expectations regarding the results, and discuss exactly what the
			link hair transplant cost, url='https://www.my-hair.uk/hair-transplant-cost'
			StaticText will be for your needs. Photographic documentation of your hair before the procedure is also conducted. This serves as a baseline to compare against the results post-surgery.
		paragraph
			StaticText Prior to the transplant, you may be advised to avoid certain medications that can thin the blood, such as aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs, for a period of time leading up to the procedure. This is to minimize any potential bleeding during surgery. Our team will provide you with a pre-operative checklist, ensuring you are well-prepared for the day of the procedure.

		heading After the Hair Transplant: Understanding Results
		paragraph
		paragraph
			StaticText The initial results from a hair transplant may not be immediately visible. In fact, it is typical for transplanted hair to shed within the first few weeks post-procedure. This can be disconcerting for some patients, but it is important to understand that this is a normal part of the hair growth cycle. The hair follicles remain intact, and new growth will typically begin within three to four months after the transplant.

			listitem
				ListMarker 0.
				paragraph
					StaticText Months 1-3
					StaticText : New hair growth will start to emerge, often appearing fine and lighter in colour than surrounding hair. This early growth may seem sparse, but it signifies that the follicles are beginning to regenerate.

					StaticText Months 4-6
					StaticText : Hair will continue to thicken and become more noticeable. Many patients begin to feel more confident as they see the transplanted hair blend seamlessly with their existing hair.
			listitem
				ListMarker 0.
				paragraph
					StaticText Months 6-12
					StaticText : At this stage, patients typically experience significant hair growth. The transplanted hair should now match the texture and colour of your natural hair. By the end of the first year, you can expect to see the full results of your hair transplant.

			StaticText Myth
			StaticText : Hair transplants are only for men.
			StaticText Fact
			StaticText : Women can also benefit significantly from hair transplants, especially those experiencing thinning due to genetic factors or conditions such as traction alopecia.
		paragraph

		paragraph
			StaticText Myth
			StaticText : Hair transplants are painful.
			StaticText Fact
			StaticText : Most patients experience minimal discomfort during and after the procedure, thanks to local anaesthesia. Recovery times are generally short, with many patients returning to normal activities within a few days.

				StaticText I had my surgery with Dr Munir at the clinic on Deansgate to sort my hair line, it's now been about 7 months and glad to report I'm seeing a really good growth of the new hair. Not a lot happened for the first few months (they tell you to expect this but it's hard not to stress until you see some results!) the new hair is blending in nicely with the old hair and filling out really well. Overall I'm really pleased, in and out same day and a very professional service all round.

Dr Shuaib has done a great job with it, If anyone is thinking of getting theirs done I'd highly recommend this place, the price was sensible and the results have been well worth it!

				StaticText I had my hairline done 2 weeks ago in Manchester with Dr Munir after my frend has fantastic results with them from his transplant last year. It's a little early to talk about final results yet and I'll update this once they are through, but very pleased with everything so far, I had about 1500 grafts and they procedure went so fast, after a long chat with the doctor to get the hairline position exactly where I wanted it. everything went really well. They were really friendly at the clinic and Daniel has been on hand answering any questions afterwards on whatsapp. The swelling went after a few days and all my little scabs had healed by about the 8th day. It's early but I'm already pleased I've got it sorted finally and I know how much better it's going to look in the photos for my wedding next summer.

				StaticText I had a 2800 graft procedure with Dr Mir in March, now 6 months down the line and I'm seeing some really good growth - it definitely took a few months before I started seeing the first hairs come through which was just as expected, then it's just got thicker and thicker. The hairline is just where I asked for and I'm getting so many positive comments from friends, it's made such a big improvement. Overall I'm very pleased with the results at this stage and theres plenty more growth to come I'm told, friendly clinic and doctor, good advice and easy to book in and follow up with.

				StaticText This was the 2nd hair transplant I've had, after one in Turkey a couple of years back, and what a difference - both in the way I was treated and the results. My surgery day was relaxed and pleasant with the nurses really looking after me all day and chatting to me during the procedure, even getting me food in at lunchtime. The recovery time was quick - around 8 days till my scabs had all come off and the head fully healed, and I'm now on month 6 and have really strong growth, already more than I saw in a year after my first procedure, I'm starting to suspect the Turkish clinic I originally went to put a lot less grafts in than they promised. It was so much less hassle getting everything done in London, and a much smaller difference in price than I was expecting, wish I'd stayed in the UK for my first one and used this company instead, big thank you to Dr Mir and all at the clinic for their good work.

				StaticText its now 6 months since my transplant at the Manchester clinic - I had 2800 hair grafts with Dr Munir, and it's looking great, I will admit to being a little worried when not much came through in the first 3 months but this was what I was told to expect, and then right on time in month 4 the first of the new baby hairs started appearing, a couple of months on they are coming through strongly already and seem to be improving every week, just in time for the summer. Apparently it's about a year before the final result but it's already such a big improvement and it's been well worth doing, I'd recommend them to anyone who isn't happy with their hair.

				StaticText My transplant took around 6 hours at the Manchester clinic back in January with Dr Munir. Nice place with friendly staff and as I fell asleep during the operation for a couple of hours in the afternoon my surgery was done before I knew it. Other than a little pain fron the anaesthetic injections at the beginning the rest of the day was comfortable and pain free (hence the sleeping!) and recovery downtime was about 10 days. Fast forward 6 months and so much has changed - the new hairline started coming through on month 3 and has slowly been getting thicker and thicker, I'm really pleased its coming through just in time for summer as it's definitely improved my appearance. Overally really pleased I went with the My Hair UK clinic, they've done a great job.

				StaticText I completed my beard transplant in January with Dr Munir and his team at the Deansgate clinic, and after 6 months of growth I can safely say my beard is looking a million times better than it used to, all the patchy areas are filled and the upper beard line is exactly where I wanted it. It was always so frustrating not being able to grow it how I wanted, I'd already tried derma rollering and also minoxidil, but neither made much difference, and the transplant has drastically improved how it looks, highly recommended!

				StaticText After having my transplant a month ago with the My Hair clinic in Harrow the overriding impression I was left with was what an easy place to deal with. Every step from my consultation to the surgery day itself and aftercare have all been simple and stress free to arrange, my surgery was done when I wanted and I got exactly the hairline position I had discussed with the doctor beforehand. The day went smoothly, and apart from the anaesthetic injections at the beginning which I was warned would be a little uncomfortable for 5 mins the whole resto of the day was pain free, I even fell asleep for a few hours in the afternoon while Dr Mir did the operation. the healing process afterwards took around a week which was no problem as I just worked from home, there was a little redness as expected for a few more weeks, now it's the just wait for the final results to come through. I'll update this further once I have the full results but so far everything has been first rate.

				StaticText Its coming up 9 months since my transplant last October and I'm very pleased to report the new hair growth has been fantastic - not much happened for the first 3 months after surgery which was as expected & I had the minor panic when the first hairs shed after a month but I was told in advance it was part of the growth process, then around month 4 new baby hairs started to appear, and it's just got thicker and thicker since then. I now have a great new hairline which looks even better than it did when I was younger and it's still improving. I have recommended a couple of family members to the clinic as they have done such a good job with mine, if you're considering getting a transplant then all I can say is I wish I'd done it a long time ago rather than putting up with embarrasing receding hair.

				StaticText It took a while to get around to booking my transplant, and now wish I'd done it years ago! The day itself went really smoothly, pain free and the clinic staff were really friendly and I was relaxed straight away. 6 months on and my new hairline is in the perfect position, it's knocked years off how old I look and I'm really looking forward to summer without a baseball cap to hide my head for the first time in ages. Great job all round and delighted with the results.

				StaticText My transplant was completed 4 weeks ago at the Manchester clinic, and while its still very early to be seeing any results yet, I'm still happy to leave a review as the clinic did a great job of looking after me, everything from the consultation with Daniel to the surgery itself with Dr Munir and his nurses was first class. really helpful friendly people who took care of everything in a very professional way. I can wait to see my final result later in the year.

				StaticText Considering this surgery has made such a big difference for me this was really straightfoward to arrange. All the staff were really helpful and have been easy to contact for follow ups and aftercare advice. Dr Munir was friendly and the surgery day itself went really smoothly. A week or so recovery time and following that it's just been waiting for the new hairs to grow through, which does seem like forever at the time, but 6 months down the line and I've got lots of new growth and a hairline that makes me look a lot younger which is exactly what I wanted. Great result and still lots more to come - I definitley recommend this place to anyone thinking about a transplant.

				StaticText 9 months down the line from having my Transplant last year at the My Hair surgery in Harrow and my head couldnt look more different. The hair is back! My hair line is where it was in my mid 20's and is still getting thicker month on month, and it's knocked years of how old I looked. I'm really happy with the work the clinic has done, given me a really natural look - highly recommended.

		heading Which Factors Influence the Cost of a Hair Transplant?
		heading ​
		paragraph
			StaticText The cost of a hair transplant is determined by several factors. Understanding these factors can help you budget accordingly and ensure you get the most out of your procedure:
		paragraph
			StaticText ​
		paragraph
			StaticText Extent of Hair Loss
			StaticText : The more extensive your hair loss, the more grafts will be needed, which impacts the cost.
		paragraph
			StaticText Area of Treatment: Whether you’re targeting a small area or larger sections like the crown and hairline, the size of the treated area will influence pricing.
		paragraph
			StaticText ​
		paragraph
			StaticText Hair Type
			StaticText : Different hair types, such as Afro-Caribbean hair, can increase the complexity of the procedure. Due to the curved structure of Afro hair follicles, these procedures require specialized techniques and expertise, potentially leading to higher costs.
		paragraph
			StaticText ​
		paragraph
			StaticText Number of Grafts:
			StaticText The number of grafts required plays a significant role in determining the price. While it might seem that more grafts automatically equal better results, that’s not necessarily true. There’s an optimal density (usually between 30-40 grafts per square cm) to ensure long-lasting and natural-looking results.
		paragraph
		paragraph
			StaticText Surgical Complexity
			StaticText : Specialized cases, such as beard transplants or fixing previous transplant issues, may involve more intricate procedures, raising the overall price.

		heading Cost of Women’s Hair Transplant
		heading ​
		paragraph
			StaticText Women's hair loss is often more complex and may result from diffuse thinning, traction alopecia, or a desire to adjust the hairline. Women typically require more grafts—often 2,000 or more—to achieve the best results. Therefore, we recommend a budget of around £2,500 - £4,500 for a single day of surgery.
		paragraph
			StaticText ​
		heading Afro-Caribbean Hair Transplant Cost
		heading ​
		paragraph
			StaticText Afro-Caribbean hair requires a specific skill set due to the curved nature of the hair follicles. This makes extraction more time-consuming and delicate. The maximum number of grafts for a single day’s surgery for this hair type is typically limited to around 2,000 grafts, and in some cases, multiple sessions are required.
		paragraph
			StaticText Expect to budget between £2,500 - £4,500 for a single day's procedure, but larger areas of hair loss may require multiple sessions spaced several months apart.

				StaticText I had my surgery with Dr Munir at the clinic on Deansgate to sort my hair line, it's now been about 7 months and glad to report I'm seeing a really good growth of the new hair. Not a lot happened for the first few months (they tell you to expect this but it's hard not to stress until you see some results!) the new hair is blending in nicely with the old hair and filling out really well. Overall I'm really pleased, in and out same day and a very professional service all round.

				StaticText Its just come up to a year since my transplant at the Harrow clinic with Dr Shuaib in December 2023 and I've just sent them my 12 month results pictures and it's night and day different, from having a badly receded front hairline it's now back to where it was in my 20s in the shape I wanted. So pleased with the results from such a simple operation, very glad I did it and I'd recommend the clinic to anyone

				StaticText It's been around 9 months since my procedure at the beginning of the year at the clinic in Harrow, and looking back at my old pictures the difference is night and day, such a massive improvement in my hair thickness in my crown area, the bald patch has gone and it seems improves a bit further every month. Dr Shuaib has done a great job with it, If anyone is thinking of getting theirs done I'd highly recommend this place, the price was sensible and the results have been well worth it!

				StaticText I had my hairline done 2 weeks ago in Manchester with Dr Munir after my frend has fantastic results with them from his transplant last year. It's a little early to talk about final results yet and I'll update this once they are through, but very pleased with everything so far, I had about 1500 grafts and they procedure went so fast, after a long chat with the doctor to get the hairline position exactly where I wanted it. everything went really well. They were really friendly at the clinic and Daniel has been on hand answering any questions afterwards on whatsapp. The swelling went after a few days and all my little scabs had healed by about the 8th day. It's early but I'm already pleased I've got it sorted finally and I know how much better it's going to look in the photos for my wedding next summer.

				StaticText I had a 2800 graft procedure with Dr Mir in March, now 6 months down the line and I'm seeing some really good growth - it definitely took a few months before I started seeing the first hairs come through which was just as expected, then it's just got thicker and thicker. The hairline is just where I asked for and I'm getting so many positive comments from friends, it's made such a big improvement. Overall I'm very pleased with the results at this stage and theres plenty more growth to come I'm told, friendly clinic and doctor, good advice and easy to book in and follow up with.

				StaticText This was the 2nd hair transplant I've had, after one in Turkey a couple of years back, and what a difference - both in the way I was treated and the results. My surgery day was relaxed and pleasant with the nurses really looking after me all day and chatting to me during the procedure, even getting me food in at lunchtime. The recovery time was quick - around 8 days till my scabs had all come off and the head fully healed, and I'm now on month 6 and have really strong growth, already more than I saw in a year after my first procedure, I'm starting to suspect the Turkish clinic I originally went to put a lot less grafts in than they promised. It was so much less hassle getting everything done in London, and a much smaller difference in price than I was expecting, wish I'd stayed in the UK for my first one and used this company instead, big thank you to Dr Mir and all at the clinic for their good work.

				StaticText its now 6 months since my transplant at the Manchester clinic - I had 2800 hair grafts with Dr Munir, and it's looking great, I will admit to being a little worried when not much came through in the first 3 months but this was what I was told to expect, and then right on time in month 4 the first of the new baby hairs started appearing, a couple of months on they are coming through strongly already and seem to be improving every week, just in time for the summer. Apparently it's about a year before the final result but it's already such a big improvement and it's been well worth doing, I'd recommend them to anyone who isn't happy with their hair.

				StaticText Great clinic, looked after me really well, the whole team were friendly from the consultation to the transplant day itself, I wasn't expecting much as I don't have the thickest hair but it's now 8 months on and my results have been really good, so I'd recommend them to anyone

				StaticText My transplant took around 6 hours at the Manchester clinic back in January with Dr Munir. Nice place with friendly staff and as I fell asleep during the operation for a couple of hours in the afternoon my surgery was done before I knew it. Other than a little pain fron the anaesthetic injections at the beginning the rest of the day was comfortable and pain free (hence the sleeping!) and recovery downtime was about 10 days. Fast forward 6 months and so much has changed - the new hairline started coming through on month 3 and has slowly been getting thicker and thicker, I'm really pleased its coming through just in time for summer as it's definitely improved my appearance. Overally really pleased I went with the My Hair UK clinic, they've done a great job.

				StaticText I completed my beard transplant in January with Dr Munir and his team at the Deansgate clinic, and after 6 months of growth I can safely say my beard is looking a million times better than it used to, all the patchy areas are filled and the upper beard line is exactly where I wanted it. It was always so frustrating not being able to grow it how I wanted, I'd already tried derma rollering and also minoxidil, but neither made much difference, and the transplant has drastically improved how it looks, highly recommended!

				StaticText I've just had my 6 month follow up consultation with Dr Alosert and everything has gone really well so far, the surgery has given me a great result and it's getting thicker and thicker every month. I cant wait to see how good it looks at the 12 month mark, really pleased I went to this clinic, they've been easy to deal with and the service has been fantastic.

				StaticText I have no hesitation in recommending this place - they have done fantastic work with my new hair. Everyone has been great to deal with and Dr Mir the surgeon was really approachable and friendly. It's 7 months since my surgery and just had a follow up consultation to make sure it's all on track and the hair regrowth has been exactly what I wanted, they are definitely worth speaking to if you are looking for a transplant in the UK that isn't silly money.

				StaticText After having my transplant a month ago with the My Hair clinic in Harrow the overriding impression I was left with was what an easy place to deal with. Every step from my consultation to the surgery day itself and aftercare have all been simple and stress free to arrange, my surgery was done when I wanted and I got exactly the hairline position I had discussed with the doctor beforehand. The day went smoothly, and apart from the anaesthetic injections at the beginning which I was warned would be a little uncomfortable for 5 mins the whole resto of the day was pain free, I even fell asleep for a few hours in the afternoon while Dr Mir did the operation. the healing process afterwards took around a week which was no problem as I just worked from home, there was a little redness as expected for a few more weeks, now it's the just wait for the final results to come through. I'll update this further once I have the full results but so far everything has been first rate.

				StaticText Its coming up 9 months since my transplant last October and I'm very pleased to report the new hair growth has been fantastic - not much happened for the first 3 months after surgery which was as expected & I had the minor panic when the first hairs shed after a month but I was told in advance it was part of the growth process, then around month 4 new baby hairs started to appear, and it's just got thicker and thicker since then. I now have a great new hairline which looks even better than it did when I was younger and it's still improving. I have recommended a couple of family members to the clinic as they have done such a good job with mine, if you're considering getting a transplant then all I can say is I wish I'd done it a long time ago rather than putting up with embarrasing receding hair.

				StaticText It took a while to get around to booking my transplant, and now wish I'd done it years ago! The day itself went really smoothly, pain free and the clinic staff were really friendly and I was relaxed straight away. 6 months on and my new hairline is in the perfect position, it's knocked years off how old I look and I'm really looking forward to summer without a baseball cap to hide my head for the first time in ages. Great job all round and delighted with the results.

				StaticText My transplant was completed 4 weeks ago at the Manchester clinic, and while its still very early to be seeing any results yet, I'm still happy to leave a review as the clinic did a great job of looking after me, everything from the consultation with Daniel to the surgery itself with Dr Munir and his nurses was first class. really helpful friendly people who took care of everything in a very professional way. I can wait to see my final result later in the year.

				StaticText Considering this surgery has made such a big difference for me this was really straightfoward to arrange. All the staff were really helpful and have been easy to contact for follow ups and aftercare advice. Dr Munir was friendly and the surgery day itself went really smoothly. A week or so recovery time and following that it's just been waiting for the new hairs to grow through, which does seem like forever at the time, but 6 months down the line and I've got lots of new growth and a hairline that makes me look a lot younger which is exactly what I wanted. Great result and still lots more to come - I definitley recommend this place to anyone thinking about a transplant.

				StaticText 9 months down the line from having my Transplant last year at the My Hair surgery in Harrow and my head couldnt look more different. The hair is back! My hair line is where it was in my mid 20's and is still getting thicker month on month, and it's knocked years of how old I looked. I'm really happy with the work the clinic has done, given me a really natural look - highly recommended.
