# Task

**User Engagement on Blog and Demo Scheduling**

As a potential Dime customer,
I explore industry insights and schedule a product demo,
so that I can understand the benefits of Dime's solutions and evaluate how they can address my business needs.

**Success definition:** Given I am a visitor on the Dime website
When I navigate to the blog section and read an article about data operations in asset-intensive industries, then click on the Book a demo link
Then I should see the demo scheduling options presented, allowing me to book a demonstration of Dime's capabilities.

		paragraph
			StaticText Thirteen years ago, at a fair in Hanover, Germany, the term “Industry 4.0” entered the industrial lexicon. The timing was fitting. The HTC Evo had just launched as the first 4G phone and 30% of Americans had adopted smartphones. Digital transformation was the buzzword of the day and the vision of smart factories with autonomous, data-driven machines seemed to be only years away.
		paragraph
			StaticText Fast forward to today, and that vision is slowly becoming reality. Across the industry, companies are taking steps to digitize operations and unlock the potential of their data. But the path to Industry 4.0 is a spectrum - some factories deploy cutting-edge ML and others still rely on clipboards to track production.
		paragraph
			StaticText Over the past few months, the Dime team has spoken to dozens of manufacturing and data engineers, and here’s what we’ve learned about where the industry stands today.
		heading The Current Landscape of Data Operations
			strong
		paragraph
			StaticText The reality for many manufacturers is shaped by legacy equipment. Machines purchased decades ago often lack the sensors or connectivity to generate meaningful data, let alone feed it into modern systems. American manufacturing’s slowdown since the 1970s left many plants with infrastructure built for a different era. Yet, despite these challenges, some industries—particularly those with continuous operations like oil & gas, chemicals, and food & beverage—are much further along in their digital journeys. These companies have the most to gain from incremental improvements, where even a 1% increase in efficiency can mean millions in savings.
		paragraph
			StaticText In contrast, discrete manufacturers, like medical device companies with human-driven assembly stations, are often able to spot issues through observation and experience. For them, the urgency to invest in data operations isn’t as strong. As a result, the maturity of data operations varies widely across industries and even within companies.
		heading Stages of Digital Transformation
			strong
		paragraph
			StaticText Manufacturers tend to fall into one of four stages on their data operations journey:
		list
			listitem
				ListMarker 0.
				strong
					StaticText Production Tracking with Basic Data Extraction
				StaticText For most manufacturers, the first step is understanding what’s happening on the factory floor. In the past, whiteboards and clipboards were the go-to tools, but they’re impractical for real-time insights in a 100K+ square foot facility. Modern machine monitoring tools now fill this gap, enabling plant managers to track production remotely. Even older machines can be retrofitted with voltage sensors to estimate cycle counts. It’s not perfect, but it’s a start.
			listitem
				ListMarker 0.
				strong
					StaticText Flexible Visualizations
				StaticText Companies with connected assets are finding new ways to visualize their operations. Tools like PowerBI have become invaluable, allowing manufacturing teams to create dashboards that transform raw data into actionable insights. By leveraging historians, manufacturers can track performance and identify bottlenecks. However, these tools often require the expertise of BI analysts to unlock their full potential.
			listitem
				ListMarker 0.
				strong
					StaticText Retroactive Analysis with Data Engineers
				StaticText The most advanced manufacturers take things further, employing teams of data engineers to analyze historical data and identify opportunities for improvement. Moving data from on-prem historians to the cloud opens up new possibilities for analysis and optimization. For companies running 24/7 operations, even small improvements in yield or uptime can have a massive impact on the bottom line.
			listitem
				ListMarker 0.
				strong
					StaticText Automated Real-Time Optimization
					StaticText ‍
				StaticText At the top of the pyramid are companies that have mastered their infrastructure and are deploying machine learning models in real time either natively in their control systems or utilizing technology like OPC UA. These teams can extract actionable insights in real-time, enabling immediate adjustments through closed feedback loops integrated directly into control systems. While this level of sophistication remains rare, it sets the standard for what’s possible and offer a glimpse into the future for manufacturers with the resources to invest.
		heading The Problem with the Status Quo
			strong
		paragraph
			StaticText Despite the progress, most manufacturers are locked out of advanced data operations. The cost of integration for top-end platforms can run into the millions, and hiring the specialized talent to make sense of the data adds an ongoing operating expense. This creates a gulf between the largest players, who have the resources to innovate, and everyone else, who are left behind.
		heading Can GenAI Actually Help?
			strong
		paragraph
			StaticText This is where GenAI has the potential to change everything. By automating complex data transformations, it can drastically reduce the time and cost of integrating advanced tools. More importantly, it can democratize access to insights. With innovations like text-to-SQL and context-based query generation, manufacturing and process engineers can interact with their data directly—no data science team required.
		paragraph
			StaticText At Dime, we’re building tools to make this vision a reality. Our platform bridges the gap, enabling manufacturers of all sizes to extract value from their data without breaking the bank.
		paragraph
			StaticText The dream of Industry 4.0 was never just about technology. It’s about creating a future where every manufacturer—big or small—can run smarter, leaner, and more connected operations.

		paragraph
			StaticText Thirteen years ago, at a fair in Hanover, Germany, the term “Industry 4.0” entered the industrial lexicon. The timing was fitting. The HTC Evo had just launched as the first 4G phone and 30% of Americans had adopted smartphones. Digital transformation was the buzzword of the day and the vision of smart factories with autonomous, data-driven machines seemed to be only years away.
		paragraph
			StaticText Fast forward to today, and that vision is slowly becoming reality. Across the industry, companies are taking steps to digitize operations and unlock the potential of their data. But the path to Industry 4.0 is a spectrum - some factories deploy cutting-edge ML and others still rely on clipboards to track production.
		paragraph
			StaticText Over the past few months, the Dime team has spoken to dozens of manufacturing and data engineers, and here’s what we’ve learned about where the industry stands today.
		heading The Current Landscape of Data Operations
			strong
		paragraph
			StaticText The reality for many manufacturers is shaped by legacy equipment. Machines purchased decades ago often lack the sensors or connectivity to generate meaningful data, let alone feed it into modern systems. American manufacturing’s slowdown since the 1970s left many plants with infrastructure built for a different era. Yet, despite these challenges, some industries—particularly those with continuous operations like oil & gas, chemicals, and food & beverage—are much further along in their digital journeys. These companies have the most to gain from incremental improvements, where even a 1% increase in efficiency can mean millions in savings.
		paragraph
			StaticText In contrast, discrete manufacturers, like medical device companies with human-driven assembly stations, are often able to spot issues through observation and experience. For them, the urgency to invest in data operations isn’t as strong. As a result, the maturity of data operations varies widely across industries and even within companies.
		heading Stages of Digital Transformation
			strong
		paragraph
			StaticText Manufacturers tend to fall into one of four stages on their data operations journey:
		list
			listitem
				ListMarker 0.
				strong
					StaticText Production Tracking with Basic Data Extraction
				StaticText For most manufacturers, the first step is understanding what’s happening on the factory floor. In the past, whiteboards and clipboards were the go-to tools, but they’re impractical for real-time insights in a 100K+ square foot facility. Modern machine monitoring tools now fill this gap, enabling plant managers to track production remotely. Even older machines can be retrofitted with voltage sensors to estimate cycle counts. It’s not perfect, but it’s a start.

				ListMarker 0.
				strong
					StaticText Flexible Visualizations
				StaticText Companies with connected assets are finding new ways to visualize their operations. Tools like PowerBI have become invaluable, allowing manufacturing teams to create dashboards that transform raw data into actionable insights. By leveraging historians, manufacturers can track performance and identify bottlenecks. However, these tools often require the expertise of BI analysts to unlock their full potential.
			listitem
				ListMarker 0.
				strong
					StaticText Retroactive Analysis with Data Engineers
				StaticText The most advanced manufacturers take things further, employing teams of data engineers to analyze historical data and identify opportunities for improvement. Moving data from on-prem historians to the cloud opens up new possibilities for analysis and optimization. For companies running 24/7 operations, even small improvements in yield or uptime can have a massive impact on the bottom line.
			listitem
				ListMarker 0.
				strong
					StaticText Automated Real-Time Optimization
					StaticText ‍
				StaticText At the top of the pyramid are companies that have mastered their infrastructure and are deploying machine learning models in real time either natively in their control systems or utilizing technology like OPC UA. These teams can extract actionable insights in real-time, enabling immediate adjustments through closed feedback loops integrated directly into control systems. While this level of sophistication remains rare, it sets the standard for what’s possible and offer a glimpse into the future for manufacturers with the resources to invest.
		heading The Problem with the Status Quo
			strong
		paragraph
			StaticText Despite the progress, most manufacturers are locked out of advanced data operations. The cost of integration for top-end platforms can run into the millions, and hiring the specialized talent to make sense of the data adds an ongoing operating expense. This creates a gulf between the largest players, who have the resources to innovate, and everyone else, who are left behind.
		heading Can GenAI Actually Help?
			strong
		paragraph
			StaticText This is where GenAI has the potential to change everything. By automating complex data transformations, it can drastically reduce the time and cost of integrating advanced tools. More importantly, it can democratize access to insights. With innovations like text-to-SQL and context-based query generation, manufacturing and process engineers can interact with their data directly—no data science team required.
		paragraph
			StaticText At Dime, we’re building tools to make this vision a reality. Our platform bridges the gap, enabling manufacturers of all sizes to extract value from their data without breaking the bank.
		paragraph
			StaticText The dream of Industry 4.0 was never just about technology. It’s about creating a future where every manufacturer—big or small—can run smarter, leaner, and more connected operations.
