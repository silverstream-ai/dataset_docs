# Task

**Schedule a Meeting**

As a potential client,
I schedule a meeting to discuss employee benefits,
so that I can learn more about how GleamCare can help my business manage employee benefits more effectively.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the GleamCare website and have clicked on the 'Explore' link under 'Employee Benefits'
When I select a 500pm time slot on the scheduling interface and fill in my details name, email, and notes
Then I should see a confirmation indicating my meeting has been successfully scheduled and receive an email with the meeting details.

**Reasoning for action:** My reasoning for this action was to follow the user story's instruction to click on the 'Explore' link under 'Employee Benefits.' This is a necessary step to access the relevant section of the website where meeting scheduling and additional information about employee benefits can be found, which is crucial for the user's task of learning how GleamCare can assist their business.

**Action:** click(78) # Click on the 'Explore' link under 'Employee Benefits'

**Change Description:** The browser transitioned from the Gleam homepage to a scheduling interface for connecting with the Gleam team, where users can select a time slot for a meeting. The URL changed to reflect the scheduling page, and the content now includes options for meeting durations, dates, and time zones instead of the initial product offerings.

**Reasoning for action:** I chose to click on the 5:00pm time slot because it is a specific time that matches the user's requirement for a scheduling interface. By selecting this, I am advancing towards the task of completing the meeting scheduling process, which is necessary for the user to learn more about how GleamCare can assist their business.

**Action:** click(259) # Click on the 5:00pm time slot to see if it leads to a scheduling interface.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 5:00pm time slot, the browser navigated to a scheduling interface where the user is now prompted to enter their name, email address, and additional notes. The URL also updated to include a parameter indicating the selected time slot.

**Reasoning for action:** I need to fill in all the required fields—name, email address, and additional notes—on the scheduling interface to complete the meeting setup. By entering 'John Doe' in the name field, 'john.doe@example.com' in the email field, and 'Looking forward to our meeting!' in the additional notes area, I ensure that I meet the criteria for confirming the meeting. Completing these fields is essential for moving forward towards receiving a confirmation and ensuring effective communication with GleamCare.

**Action:** fill(317, 'John Doe') # Fill in the name field
fill(326, 'john.doe@example.com') # Fill in the email address field
fill(354, 'Looking forward to our meeting!') # Fill in additional notes

**Change Description:** The name field was filled with 'John Doe', the email address field was filled with 'john.doe@example.com', and the additional notes field was filled with 'Looking forward to our meeting!', indicating that the user has provided their details for the meeting.
