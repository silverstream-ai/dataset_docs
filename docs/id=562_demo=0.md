# Task

**User Engagement through Contact Form Submission**

As a potential partner in the real estate industry,,
I submit my contact information and request a meeting with the Ryse team,,
so that I can explore partnership opportunities and understand how Ryse can support my business needs.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the 'Contact Us' page after navigating from the Ryse homepage
When I fill in my personal information and submit the contact form
Then I should see a confirmation of my request and be able to select a meeting time with the Ryse team.

**Reasoning for action:** I started by filling in the required fields one by one to ensure that all necessary personal information is provided for the contact form. After entering the first name, last name, email address, phone number, and company name, I selected 'Experience Provider' as my industry. Completing these actions fulfills the form requirements, allowing me to request a meeting effectively. Finally, I clicked the submit button to send my information to the Ryse team. This action is crucial as it initiates my request for a partnership meeting and sets the stage for the confirmation step to follow.

**Action:** fill('56', 'John') # Fill in the first name
fill('59', 'Doe') # Fill in the last name
fill('62', 'john.doe@example.com') # Fill in the email address
fill('66', '1234567890') # Fill in the phone number
fill('70', 'Example Company') # Fill in the company name
select_option('74', ['Experience Provider']) # Select an industry option
click(86) # Click on the submit button to submit the form.

**Change Description:** The user filled out a form with their personal information, selected the 'Experience Provider' option from a dropdown menu, and submitted the form. This resulted in a transition to a new page with a focus on scheduling a meeting, displaying a calendar and available time slots for a meeting.
