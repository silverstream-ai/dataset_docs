# Task

**Schedule a Demo with DraftAid**

As a potential customer,
I schedule a demo for DraftAid's services,
so that I can see how DraftAid can improve my design process with its AI-powered automation.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the DraftAid homepage and I want to explore the demo scheduling process
When I click on the 'Schedule a Demo' link and fill in my email address followed by clicking the 'Schedule a Demo' button
Then I should be directed to a Calendly interface where I can select a date and time for the demo.

	paragraph
	paragraph
		StaticText When I first got my hands on the DraftAid demo, I was pretty excited but also a bit anxious. It seemed like a great tool to cut down on the tedious tasks, yet I was concerned that it might be tough to get the hang of and take up a lot of time. And I was really curious about how it would manage the more complex stuff, like those detailed curtainwall profiles.
	paragraph
		StaticText Turns out, I was pleasantly surprised! I found myself quickly creating drawings with just one click, and they barely needed any extra finessing from me. What’s more, DraftAid was impressively accurate in picking up on those nuances that sometimes even the experienced drafters overlook.
	paragraph
		StaticText Getting on board with this AI tech has really upped the game for our work. It's made our drawings more accurate, cut down on errors, and saved a bunch of time. Sure, it's not perfect yet, but the potential DraftAid has is huge. It’s making a big difference for folks in design, engineering, modeling, and fabrication by helping produce really high-quality drawings.

	paragraph
	paragraph
		StaticText When I first came across DraftAid, to be honest, I wasn’t sure about it. Experience has taught me that AI tools have their limitations. The question nagging at me was: sure, it can crank out drawings, but would they be clear and straightforward enough for everyone on my team to understand?
	paragraph
		StaticText Yet, as I started to use DraftAid, I've got to say it's been quite the game-changer. It's a real time-saver and consistently nails the details, especially with dimensions for holes and slots. And man, has it sped up my process of making drawings by 3X!
	paragraph
		StaticText Of course, being an AI tool, there was a bit of a learning phase with DraftAid. I needed to invest some time to "train" it to deliver drawings the way we needed. But throughout this process, the DraftAid team was right there with me, super supportive and active.
	paragraph
		StaticText So far, DraftAid has been impressively solid. And given the commitment I've seen from the DraftAid team, I'm pretty excited about its future in making manual drawing a thing of the past.

	heading “ A Bit Nervous About Using DraftAid, But It's Been Great
	paragraph
	paragraph
		StaticText When I first got my hands on the DraftAid demo, I was pretty excited but also a bit anxious. It seemed like a great tool to cut down on the tedious tasks, yet I was concerned that it might be tough to get the hang of and take up a lot of time. And I was really curious about how it would manage the more complex stuff, like those detailed curtainwall profiles.
	paragraph
		StaticText Turns out, I was pleasantly surprised! I found myself quickly creating drawings with just one click, and they barely needed any extra finessing from me. What’s more, DraftAid was impressively accurate in picking up on those nuances that sometimes even the experienced drafters overlook.
	paragraph
		StaticText Getting on board with this AI tech has really upped the game for our work. It's made our drawings more accurate, cut down on errors, and saved a bunch of time. Sure, it's not perfect yet, but the potential DraftAid has is huge. It’s making a big difference for folks in design, engineering, modeling, and fabrication by helping produce really high-quality drawings.

	heading ‘ Wasn't Sure About DraftAid, But It's Winning Me Over
	paragraph
	paragraph
		StaticText When I first came across DraftAid, to be honest, I wasn’t sure about it. Experience has taught me that AI tools have their limitations. The question nagging at me was: sure, it can crank out drawings, but would they be clear and straightforward enough for everyone on my team to understand?
	paragraph
		StaticText Yet, as I started to use DraftAid, I've got to say it's been quite the game-changer. It's a real time-saver and consistently nails the details, especially with dimensions for holes and slots. And man, has it sped up my process of making drawings by 3X!
	paragraph
		StaticText Of course, being an AI tool, there was a bit of a learning phase with DraftAid. I needed to invest some time to "train" it to deliver drawings the way we needed. But throughout this process, the DraftAid team was right there with me, super supportive and active.
	paragraph
		StaticText So far, DraftAid has been impressively solid. And given the commitment I've seen from the DraftAid team, I'm pretty excited about its future in making manual drawing a thing of the past.

		StaticText Turns out, I was pleasantly surprised! I found myself quickly creating drawings with just one click, and they barely needed any extra finessing from me. What’s more, DraftAid was impressively accurate in picking up on those nuances that sometimes even the experienced drafters overlook.
	paragraph
		StaticText Getting on board with this AI tech has really upped the game for our work. It's made our drawings more accurate, cut down on errors, and saved a bunch of time. Sure, it's not perfect yet, but the potential DraftAid has is huge. It’s making a big difference for folks in design, engineering, modeling, and fabrication by helping produce really high-quality drawings.

	heading ‘ Wasn't Sure About DraftAid, But It's Winning Me Over
	paragraph
	paragraph
		StaticText When I first came across DraftAid, to be honest, I wasn’t sure about it. Experience has taught me that AI tools have their limitations. The question nagging at me was: sure, it can crank out drawings, but would they be clear and straightforward enough for everyone on my team to understand?
	paragraph
		StaticText Yet, as I started to use DraftAid, I've got to say it's been quite the game-changer. It's a real time-saver and consistently nails the details, especially with dimensions for holes and slots. And man, has it sped up my process of making drawings by 3X!
	paragraph
		StaticText Of course, being an AI tool, there was a bit of a learning phase with DraftAid. I needed to invest some time to "train" it to deliver drawings the way we needed. But throughout this process, the DraftAid team was right there with me, super supportive and active.
	paragraph
		StaticText So far, DraftAid has been impressively solid. And given the commitment I've seen from the DraftAid team, I'm pretty excited about its future in making manual drawing a thing of the past.

**Reasoning for action:** By clicking the 'Schedule a Demo' button (identified by its ID '415'), I am following the process outlined in the user story to submit the email entered in the textbox. This action is essential as it initiates the transition to the next step of the demo scheduling process, which is to display the Calendly interface where the user can choose their preferred date and time for the demo. This directly fulfills the user's intent of exploring the demo scheduling process.

**Action:** click('415') # Click on the 'Schedule a Demo' button to submit the email and proceed with scheduling.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'Schedule a Demo' button, the browser transitioned to a new page displaying a Calendly interface for scheduling a call with the DraftAid team, including options to select a date and time for the demo.
