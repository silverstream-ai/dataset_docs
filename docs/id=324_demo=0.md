# Task

**Booking a Call with Reworks**

As a potential customer,
I book a call with the Reworks team,
so that I can discuss my integration needs and how their solutions can help my business.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Reworks homepage and have clicked on the 'Book a call' link
When I fill in my name, email, company website, and additional information, and successfully submit the form
Then I should receive a confirmation message indicating my submission was successful and view a 'Thank you' message.

**Reasoning for action:** I clicked on the 'Book a call' link because it is the primary action that directly leads me to the form necessary for booking a call with the Reworks team about their integration solutions. This step is essential for progressing towards filling in my name, email, company website, and additional information, which are required to successfully submit the form and receive a confirmation message.

**Action:** click(49) # Click on the 'Book a call' link to explore the booking process.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'Book a call' link, the browser navigated to the booking form page where users can input their name, email, company website, and additional information, featuring a submit button for further action.

</details>

**Reasoning for action:** My reasoning for taking this action is that filling out the form fields with accurate details is essential to express the user's intent to discuss integration needs with the Reworks team. By entering information in the Name, Email, and Company website fields, I ensure the Reworks team can contact the user effectively. Providing additional information in the last textbox helps prepare the team for the call. Finally, clicking the Submit button submits the form, which is necessary to complete the booking process and receive a confirmation message, aligning with the task's criteria.

**Action:** fill(53, 'Jane Smith') # Fill in the Name field
fill(58, 'name@gmail.com') # Fill in the Email field
fill(63, 'www.website.com') # Fill in the Company website field
fill(68, 'E.g. systems you are looking to integrate with, timelines etc.') # Fill in the additional information field
click(71) # Click on the Submit button to submit the form.

**Change Description:** The Name, Email, Company website, and additional information fields were filled with user-provided inputs. An alert indicating an issue with the Email input was triggered, and the Email and additional information textboxes now reflect the entered values, along with their corresponding issues as indicated by the alert.

		paragraph
```
</details>

**Reasoning for action:** The email field currently contains an incorrect format ('Jane Smithname@gmail.com'), which needs to be corrected to enable successful form submission. By replacing it with a valid email format ('name@gmail.com'), I reduce the chances of encountering an error when the form is submitted. This change advances the task by ensuring all required fields meet the criteria for submission.

**Action:** fill(58, 'name@gmail.com') # Correct the Email field to a valid format
click(71) # Click on the Submit button again to attempt form submission.

**Change Description:** The email field was updated to a valid email format 'name@gmail.com', and upon clicking the Submit button, the button changed its label from 'Submit' to 'Thank you', indicating successful submission of the form.
