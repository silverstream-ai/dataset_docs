# Task

**User Story for Navigation Attempt**

As a website explorer,
I navigate to the example website to view its content,
so that I can learn more about the services offered by the site.

**Success definition:** Given I am a user attempting to explore a website
When I try to navigate to 'httpswww.example.com' multiple times
Then I should see that the navigation did not succeed, and the URL remains at 'aboutblank'.

## Trajectory

**Step 1:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** I need to use the 'goto' function to attempt to navigate to 'https://www.example.com' so that I can access the content of the website as per the user story requirement. This should ideally change the current URL from 'about:blank' to 'https://www.example.com', allowing me to fulfill the user's request to explore the services offered by the site.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser attempted to navigate to 'https://www.example.com', but the URL remained unchanged as 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation was unsuccessful or the page did not load.

**Step 2:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** The user's goal is to explore 'https://www.example.com' to learn about the services it offers. By attempting to navigate to this URL, I am actively trying to fulfill the user's request. However, since the current browser state shows the URL as 'about:blank', this indicates that the navigation was unsuccessful. The next step would involve checking if the page has loaded or if there are any errors preventing the navigation.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser state did not change its URL or focus as the navigation to 'https://www.example.com' did not occur; it remains at 'about:blank' with the focus still on the RootWebArea.

**Step 3:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** My reasoning for this action was to fulfill the user story by initiating navigation to the specified website. However, since the current URL is 'about:blank', it indicates that no useful page is loaded. This action is aimed at enabling the user to explore the website's content directly.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser attempted to navigate to 'https://www.example.com', but the URL did not change from 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation did not successfully occur.
