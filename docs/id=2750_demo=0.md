# Task

**Exploring Abalone Bio's Offerings**

As a potential collaborator or investor interested in biotechnology innovations,
I explore the available platforms, pipelines, and partnerships,
so that I can evaluate Abalone Bio's capabilities and potential for collaboration or investment.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Abalone Bio website homepage
When I click on the 'Platform' link, then navigate to the 'Pipeline', and finally to the 'Partnerships' page
Then I should see detailed information regarding Abalone Bio's antibody platform, current projects in the pipeline, and collaboration opportunities with the company.

	heading Platform
	heading Enabling discovery and design of target-activating antibodies through large-scale activity measurement
	paragraph
		StaticText Abalone Bio's FAST platform leverages engineered cells to evaluate hundreds of millions of antibodies simultaneously, assessing their ability to modify the activity of a target rather than merely binding to it. By producing extensive sequence-activity datasets, FAST not only uncovers rare activators for challenging targets like G-protein-coupled receptors but also enables their AI-powered design.
	StaticText The problem
	heading Lack of large-scale activity measurement was a major roadblock to target-activating antibodies
	paragraph
		StaticText The lack of large-scale activity measurement has been a significant obstacle in creating target-activating antibodies, particularly for GPCRs and other membrane proteins. These targets present unique challenges.
	heading Why are GPCRs and other membrane targets hard?
	image Proteins graphics, url='https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/673e4ec5b5b3505435f8999c/673e4ec5b5b3505435f89a20_problem-12x.png'
	heading Proteins are hard to produce
	paragraph
		StaticText Many in vitro discovery methods require large amounts of homogenous, properly folded protein. GPCRs are complex membrane proteins that are difficult to produce and purify.

	StaticText The solution
	heading Introducing FAST
	paragraph
		StaticText our Functional Antibody Selection Technology platform
	paragraph
		StaticText Measuring activity, not just binding, in high-throughput by harnessing “survival of the fittest” with engineered biology.
	heading We harness Nature’s original algorithm
	StaticText We have engineered cells to each measure the activity of a single antibody sequence variant - a massively parallel biological computer.
	heading Engineering FAST cells to proliferate if carrying a functional antibody
	StaticText We engineer each of FAST’s yeast cells- a synthetic biology workhorse eukaryotic organism similar to a simplified human cell- to produce a functional human target protein and a single antibody variant per cell.
	heading Enabling discovery and creation of rare functional antibodies with large-scale functional datasets
	StaticText We produce growth curves that reflect function for hundreds of millions of antibody sequences. These data are mined to discover rare hits in large antibody libraries, and to train protein LLMs to extrapolate into novel sequence space to create optimized hits.
	heading Our FAST platform addresses fundamental challenges in antibody discovery and design, paving the way for breakthroughs for previously intractable targets.
	heading The conventional focus on affinity  is flawed
	StaticText Affinity
	StaticText Activity
	heading Our technology directly measures activity of all antibodies, eliminating biases from binding-based methods
	paragraph
		StaticText Existing large-scale discovery technologies focus on attributes like binding affinity first, largely because that is historically an easy property to score and optimize.
		StaticText Activity is tested very late in the discovery process on a few high-affinity antibodies targeting regions that may have nothing to do with altering the activity of the target. It’s like tightly grabbing a pair of scissors by the blades instead of more loosely by the handle- a high affinity but non-functional interaction.
	heading Our large-scale activity datasets unlock the power of AI for activating antibody design
	paragraph
		StaticText Other AI methods use static protein structures to attempt binding prediction, falling short for predicting activating binders for dynamic, large, complex membrane targets like GPCRs. FAST broadly samples the experimental landscape of antibody activity.
		StaticText One FAST campaign generates activity datasets nearly 10X bigger than sequence datasets used to train class-leading antibody foundation models. By combining pre-trained antibody language models and our datasets, we enable model-enriched discovery and generative design of more active, developable antibodies.

	heading Lack of large-scale activity measurement was a major roadblock to target-activating antibodies
	paragraph
		StaticText The lack of large-scale activity measurement has been a significant obstacle in creating target-activating antibodies, particularly for GPCRs and other membrane proteins. These targets present unique challenges.
	heading Why are GPCRs and other membrane targets hard?

	heading Proteins are hard to produce
	paragraph
		StaticText Many in vitro discovery methods require large amounts of homogenous, properly folded protein. GPCRs are complex membrane proteins that are difficult to produce and purify.

	StaticText The solution
	heading Introducing FAST
	paragraph
		StaticText our Functional Antibody Selection Technology platform
	paragraph
		StaticText Measuring activity, not just binding, in high-throughput by harnessing “survival of the fittest” with engineered biology.
	heading We harness Nature’s original algorithm
	StaticText We have engineered cells to each measure the activity of a single antibody sequence variant - a massively parallel biological computer.
	heading Engineering FAST cells to proliferate if carrying a functional antibody
	StaticText We engineer each of FAST’s yeast cells- a synthetic biology workhorse eukaryotic organism similar to a simplified human cell- to produce a functional human target protein and a single antibody variant per cell.
	heading Enabling discovery and creation of rare functional antibodies with large-scale functional datasets
	StaticText We produce growth curves that reflect function for hundreds of millions of antibody sequences. These data are mined to discover rare hits in large antibody libraries, and to train protein LLMs to extrapolate into novel sequence space to create optimized hits.
	heading Our FAST platform addresses fundamental challenges in antibody discovery and design, paving the way for breakthroughs for previously intractable targets.
	heading The conventional focus on affinity  is flawed
	StaticText Affinity
	StaticText Activity
	heading Our technology directly measures activity of all antibodies, eliminating biases from binding-based methods
	paragraph
		StaticText Existing large-scale discovery technologies focus on attributes like binding affinity first, largely because that is historically an easy property to score and optimize.
		StaticText Activity is tested very late in the discovery process on a few high-affinity antibodies targeting regions that may have nothing to do with altering the activity of the target. It’s like tightly grabbing a pair of scissors by the blades instead of more loosely by the handle- a high affinity but non-functional interaction.
	heading Our large-scale activity datasets unlock the power of AI for activating antibody design
	paragraph
		StaticText Other AI methods use static protein structures to attempt binding prediction, falling short for predicting activating binders for dynamic, large, complex membrane targets like GPCRs. FAST broadly samples the experimental landscape of antibody activity.
		StaticText One FAST campaign generates activity datasets nearly 10X bigger than sequence datasets used to train class-leading antibody foundation models. By combining pre-trained antibody language models and our datasets, we enable model-enriched discovery and generative design of more active, developable antibodies.

		StaticText Our specific, activating antibodies address the liabilities of other drugs for challenging targets: they have the specificity that small molecules and peptides often don’t, and the activity that other antibodies typically lack. Antibodies have long half-lives, unlike some small molecules and peptides, making them very effective for chronic conditions. Antibodies also have the chemical and large structural complexity to better mimic large ligands, like chemokines, and interact with multiple parts of the target for effective activation.
