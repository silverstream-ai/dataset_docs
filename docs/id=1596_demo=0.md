# Task

**User Story for Installing Demo Gorilla Extension**

As a new user of Demo Gorilla,
I learn how to install and pin the Presenter Notes extension,
so that I can utilize the extension effectively during product demos to enhance my selling capabilities.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Demo Gorilla website and have accessed the Getting Started documentation
When I click on the 'Install the Presenter Notes extension' link and follow the installation instructions
Then I should be able to see clear instructions on how to install the extension, and further, upon clicking the 'Pin the extension to the menu bar' link, I should be directed to specific steps on how to pin the extension for easier access.

		paragraph
			StaticText When we’re giving a demo, it’s too easy to talk about what
			strong
				StaticText we
			StaticText are doing instead of why this feature is valuable
			strong
				StaticText to the customer
			StaticText , so let’s make that our first talking point.
		paragraph
			StaticText “Talking points” are hints to our demo-ers about what to remember to say. Ideally they should be bullet points, intended to remind not be read verbatim. By writing good talking points your demoers can focus on the customer interaction instead of racking their brains for what to say. They also allow your team to share the best messaging across the organization and keep it up to date. (You can read more about talking points
			link here, url='https://demogorilla.com/docs/talking-points'
			StaticText . ) Go to the Talking Points page in the app and click “Add a talking point”
		paragraph
			image Add talking point, url='https://demogorilla.com/screenshots/app-talking-points2-highlight.png'
		paragraph
			StaticText Let’s give it a title: “Great things about Ticketr”
		paragraph
			StaticText And replace the content (feel free to copy and paste this text or make up your own):
		code
			StaticText Ticketr uses 
- **Machine Learning** from top PhDs
- **Artificial intelligence** to make your team's life easier
- Saves *25%* of your manager's time on average
- Causes %17% fewer mis-filed tickets
- 600 of the Fortune 500 use it
		paragraph
			StaticText Leave the rest of the options alone and press “Add” and you’ll have made your first talking point.
		paragraph
			image Add talking point, url='https://demogorilla.com/screenshots/sample-talking-point-highlight.png'
		paragraph
			StaticText Let’s see your new talking point in the presenter notes! You can either press the Demo Gorilla button in your browser, or refresh the extension while on the site you authorized:
		paragraph
			image Refresh, url='https://demogorilla.com/screenshots/ext-menu-refresh-highlight.png'
		paragraph
			StaticText And you’ll see your content (you may need to scroll). Something you’ll notice is the text transformed a little: the “-” became a real bullet and the “**” made the text bold. That’s called “Markdown”.
		paragraph
			image Refresh, url='https://demogorilla.com/screenshots/ext-new-content-highlight.png'
		paragraph
			StaticText By default all talking points start out as only visible to you. When you’re ready to share them, click the “…” button on the
			link Talking Points, url='https://app.demogorilla.com/talking_points'
			StaticText page and share it:
		paragraph
			image Share, url='https://demogorilla.com/screenshots/app-talking-point-dropdown-highlight.png'
		paragraph
			StaticText Bonus: You can see the talking point stared off with some text. That’s a template and is customizable in

			StaticText Nothing is more boring than sitting through a slide presentation when you expected a demo - but sometimes we need the slides to lay the groundwork for the amazing feature you’re about to show off.
		paragraph
			StaticText Demo Gorilla makes it easy to show

				StaticText and
			StaticText tell while keeping the demo moving along. Let’s make our first action: to display a Google Slide (we have a

		paragraph
			StaticText Let’s add a slide to explain TicketR’s “Suggestions” feature. Go to the “

		paragraph
			StaticText When you’re filling in the values, the first thing you notice is that Demo Gorilla wants to help you by tweaking the URL. When you copy & paste a URL from a Google Slide it shows all the editing toolbars and menus. When you press “Use recommendation”, Demo Gorilla will change the URL to present just the slide.
		paragraph
			image Use recommendation, url='https://demogorilla.com/screenshots/app-adding-action-recommendation-highlight.png'
		paragraph
			StaticText We’re only going to make this action appear when we’re on the Suggestions page which is “

		paragraph
			StaticText Of course not all demos are to the same people! What resonates with one audience might not with another.
		paragraph
			StaticText Demo Gorilla uses tags to customize your content based on the audience much like we used pages to customize content based on what you’re showing.
		paragraph
			StaticText You should already have some sample content on the “
			link Tags, url='https://app.demogorilla.com/organization/tags'

					StaticText CompetitorX
				StaticText will create a button in the Presenter Notes that you can turn on or off

		paragraph
			StaticText Go to the
			link Searchable content, url='https://app.demogorilla.com/talking_points/searchables'
			StaticText tab on the Talking Points page and press “Add searchable content”. You’ll notice you don’t have to define “When it’s shown” since this talking point is

</details>

**Reasoning for action:** I clicked on the 'Getting Started' link (41) because this is where I can find the foundational steps for a new user like myself. This action takes me closer to my goal of obtaining instructions on how to install and use the Presenter Notes extension, which is essential for completing the assigned task.

**Action:** click(41) # Click on the 'Getting Started' link to explore the initial steps for using the product.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'Getting Started' link, the browser navigated to a new page titled 'Your First Demo' on Demo Gorilla, which provides detailed guidance and resources for setting up and using the product, replacing the previous content related to making SaaS demos awesome.

		paragraph
			StaticText When we’re giving a demo, it’s too easy to talk about what
			strong
				StaticText we
			StaticText are doing instead of why this feature is valuable
			strong
				StaticText to the customer
			StaticText , so let’s make that our first talking point.
		paragraph
			StaticText “Talking points” are hints to our demo-ers about what to remember to say. Ideally they should be bullet points, intended to remind not be read verbatim. By writing good talking points your demoers can focus on the customer interaction instead of racking their brains for what to say. They also allow your team to share the best messaging across the organization and keep it up to date. (You can read more about talking points
			link here, url='https://demogorilla.com/docs/talking-points'
			StaticText . ) Go to the Talking Points page in the app and click “Add a talking point”
		paragraph
			image Add talking point, url='https://demogorilla.com/screenshots/app-talking-points2-highlight.png'
		paragraph
			StaticText Let’s give it a title: “Great things about Ticketr”
		paragraph
			StaticText And replace the content (feel free to copy and paste this text or make up your own):
		code
			StaticText Ticketr uses 
- **Machine Learning** from top PhDs
- **Artificial intelligence** to make your team's life easier
- Saves *25%* of your manager's time on average
- Causes %17% fewer mis-filed tickets
- 600 of the Fortune 500 use it
		paragraph
			StaticText Leave the rest of the options alone and press “Add” and you’ll have made your first talking point.
		paragraph
			image Add talking point, url='https://demogorilla.com/screenshots/sample-talking-point-highlight.png'
		paragraph
			StaticText Let’s see your new talking point in the presenter notes! You can either press the Demo Gorilla button in your browser, or refresh the extension while on the site you authorized:
		paragraph
			image Refresh, url='https://demogorilla.com/screenshots/ext-menu-refresh-highlight.png'
		paragraph
			StaticText And you’ll see your content (you may need to scroll). Something you’ll notice is the text transformed a little: the “-” became a real bullet and the “**” made the text bold. That’s called “Markdown”.
		paragraph
			image Refresh, url='https://demogorilla.com/screenshots/ext-new-content-highlight.png'
		paragraph
			StaticText By default all talking points start out as only visible to you. When you’re ready to share them, click the “…” button on the
			link Talking Points, url='https://app.demogorilla.com/talking_points'
			StaticText page and share it:
		paragraph
			image Share, url='https://demogorilla.com/screenshots/app-talking-point-dropdown-highlight.png'
		paragraph
			StaticText Bonus: You can see the talking point stared off with some text. That’s a template and is customizable in

			StaticText Demo Gorilla makes it easy to show

				StaticText and
			StaticText tell while keeping the demo moving along. Let’s make our first action: to display a Google Slide (we have a

		paragraph
			StaticText Let’s add a slide to explain TicketR’s “Suggestions” feature. Go to the “

		paragraph
			StaticText When you’re filling in the values, the first thing you notice is that Demo Gorilla wants to help you by tweaking the URL. When you copy & paste a URL from a Google Slide it shows all the editing toolbars and menus. When you press “Use recommendation”, Demo Gorilla will change the URL to present just the slide.
		paragraph
			image Use recommendation, url='https://demogorilla.com/screenshots/app-adding-action-recommendation-highlight.png'

			StaticText We’re only going to make this action appear when we’re on the Suggestions page which is “

		paragraph
			StaticText Of course not all demos are to the same people! What resonates with one audience might not with another.
		paragraph
			StaticText Demo Gorilla uses tags to customize your content based on the audience much like we used pages to customize content based on what you’re showing.
		paragraph
			StaticText You should already have some sample content on the “
			link Tags, url='https://app.demogorilla.com/organization/tags'

		paragraph
			StaticText Sometimes a customer asks a question. Instead of getting stumped, Demo Gorilla lets you search all the talking points. There are so many things you

			StaticText Go to the
			link Searchable content, url='https://app.demogorilla.com/talking_points/searchables'
			StaticText tab on the Talking Points page and press “Add searchable content”. You’ll notice you don’t have to define “When it’s shown” since this talking point is

			StaticText When we’re giving a demo, it’s too easy to talk about what
			strong
				StaticText we
			StaticText are doing instead of why this feature is valuable
			strong
				StaticText to the customer
			StaticText , so let’s make that our first talking point.
		paragraph
			StaticText “Talking points” are hints to our demo-ers about what to remember to say. Ideally they should be bullet points, intended to remind not be read verbatim. By writing good talking points your demoers can focus on the customer interaction instead of racking their brains for what to say. They also allow your team to share the best messaging across the organization and keep it up to date. (You can read more about talking points
			link here, url='https://demogorilla.com/docs/talking-points'
			StaticText . ) Go to the Talking Points page in the app and click “Add a talking point”
		paragraph
			image Add talking point, url='https://demogorilla.com/screenshots/app-talking-points2-highlight.png'
		paragraph
			StaticText Let’s give it a title: “Great things about Ticketr”
		paragraph
			StaticText And replace the content (feel free to copy and paste this text or make up your own):

			StaticText Ticketr uses 
- **Machine Learning** from top PhDs
- **Artificial intelligence** to make your team's life easier
- Saves *25%* of your manager's time on average
- Causes %17% fewer mis-filed tickets
- 600 of the Fortune 500 use it
		paragraph
			StaticText Leave the rest of the options alone and press “Add” and you’ll have made your first talking point.
		paragraph
			image Add talking point, url='https://demogorilla.com/screenshots/sample-talking-point-highlight.png'

			StaticText Let’s see your new talking point in the presenter notes! You can either press the Demo Gorilla button in your browser, or refresh the extension while on the site you authorized:
		paragraph
			image Refresh, url='https://demogorilla.com/screenshots/ext-menu-refresh-highlight.png'
		paragraph
			StaticText And you’ll see your content (you may need to scroll). Something you’ll notice is the text transformed a little: the “-” became a real bullet and the “**” made the text bold. That’s called “Markdown”.
		paragraph
			image Refresh, url='https://demogorilla.com/screenshots/ext-new-content-highlight.png'
		paragraph
			StaticText By default all talking points start out as only visible to you. When you’re ready to share them, click the “…” button on the

			StaticText page and share it:
		paragraph

			StaticText When you’re filling in the values, the first thing you notice is that Demo Gorilla wants to help you by tweaking the URL. When you copy & paste a URL from a Google Slide it shows all the editing toolbars and menus. When you press “Use recommendation”, Demo Gorilla will change the URL to present just the slide.

		paragraph
			StaticText Of course not all demos are to the same people! What resonates with one audience might not with another.
		paragraph
			StaticText Demo Gorilla uses tags to customize your content based on the audience much like we used pages to customize content based on what you’re showing.
		paragraph
			StaticText You should already have some sample content on the “
			link Tags, url='https://app.demogorilla.com/organization/tags'

**Action:** click(265) # Click on the 'Install the Presenter Notes extension' link to explore how to install the extension.

		paragraph
			StaticText “Talking points” are hints to our demo-ers about what to remember to say. Ideally they should be bullet points, intended to remind not be read verbatim. By writing good talking points your demoers can focus on the customer interaction instead of racking their brains for what to say. They also allow your team to share the best messaging across the organization and keep it up to date. (You can read more about talking points

			StaticText When you’re filling in the values, the first thing you notice is that Demo Gorilla wants to help you by tweaking the URL. When you copy & paste a URL from a Google Slide it shows all the editing toolbars and menus. When you press “Use recommendation”, Demo Gorilla will change the URL to present just the slide.

		paragraph
			StaticText Of course not all demos are to the same people! What resonates with one audience might not with another.
		paragraph
			StaticText Demo Gorilla uses tags to customize your content based on the audience much like we used pages to customize content based on what you’re showing.
		paragraph
			StaticText You should already have some sample content on the “
