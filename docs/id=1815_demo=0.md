# Task

**User Journey through Astek Diagnostics Website**

As a healthcare professional,
I understand how Astek Diagnostics tackles the challenges of UTI diagnostics and antimicrobial resistance,
so that I can provide better-informed decisions about treatment options for my patients.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Astek Diagnostics homepage
When I click on the 'Problem' link and explore the issues it addresses, click on the 'Solution' link to learn about their approach to AMR, and finally click on the 'Grand vision' link to understand their long-term goals
Then I should see detailed information on the challenges Astek Diagnostics aims to solve, the JIDDU platform's effectiveness, and the company's vision for future advancements in diagnostic technology.

				StaticText At Astek Diagnostics, we are creating the JIDDU system, an innovative clinical diagnostics platform that offers infection confirmation for urinary tract infections (UTIs) and antibiotic sensitivity indication within 1 hour.
				StaticText The JIDDU system greatly improves diagnostic speed and accuracy, thereby reducing patient complications and pain, as well as lowering healthcare costs. It represents a significant leap forward in patient care that allows for much more timely and accurate treatment than the current standard of care. This ultimately leads to saving lives, given that 25% of sepsis cases are caused by UTIs.
				StaticText Given that women get UTIs up to 30 times more often than men, the development and deployment of the JIDDU system would have major implications on FemHealth.

				StaticText "The Jiddu Platform by Astek Diagnostics is a groundbreaking advancement in point-of-care testing for UTIs. In just about an hour, it enables doctors to make real-time treatment decisions by identifying active infections and determining which antibiotics are likely to work. This is a true game changer. I’m excited to use this technology to deliver faster, more precise care for my patients, without having to depend on dipstick tests or traditional cultures that take days. It even outpaces the speed of expensive urine PCR tests currently being used."

			heading CEO at Astek Diagnostics
			paragraph
				StaticText In 2021, the growing issue of antibiotic resistant UTIs became personal for Mustafa. His grandfather was suffered from agonizing pain for days before being diagnosed with a UTI and being treated with the right antibiotic. Mustafa’s family felt entirely helpless during this experience.
				StaticText Recognizing the need for a solution, Mustafa founded Astek Diagnostics. Ever since, he has been dedicated to revolutionizing the way antibiotics are prescribed to patients.
				StaticText Today, in partnership with key healthcare institutions such, including The University of Maryland Medical Center and MedStar Health, Astek Diagnostics has achieved exceptional initial results and is well on its way to a market entry in 2025.

			heading Simplified diagnostic process
			heading The JIDDU platform unlocks effortless diagnostics, simplifying complex tests with minimal training
			paragraph
				StaticText Our benchtop analyzer can identify the presence of a bacterial infection in urine and then perform antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) of the bacterium in one hour. This will inform physicians which antibiotics would be best to give to patients in a short period of time.
			heading How it works
			paragraph
				StaticText 1
			heading Place the sample into the cartidge
			paragraph
				StaticText The sample is placed in a specialized microfluidic cartridge. The type of cartridge utilized varies with the sample type. Once attached, the cartridge is placed in the device and the automated testing process begins.

			paragraph
				StaticText 2
			heading Bacteria from the sample is captured
			paragraph
				StaticText Through an automated filtering process, the bacteria is captured from the sample. For the blood panel, this capturing process incorporates a step to eliminate hemoglobin from lysed blood cells.

			paragraph
				StaticText 3
			heading Cultivation and antibiotic testing
			paragraph
				StaticText The sample is subdivided into multiple channels, allowing it to be mixed with specified antibiotics, as well as have two control channels. Once divided and mixed, the sample channels are cultivated for 35 minutes in a conducive media.

				StaticText Our vision is to develop the JIDDU system into a multipurpose diagnostic platform which is able to confirm bacterial infections and assess antibiotic sensitivity across 4 sample types: urine, CSF, effluent, and blood.

				StaticText The traditional two-day wait for culture results is perilous, particularly in meningitis cases—a severe inflammation of the brain and spinal cord's protective membranes. Annually, meningitis affects 600 to 1,000 individuals in the US, with a 10-15% fatality rate and about 20% of survivors enduring permanent disabilities like brain damage or hearing loss​​.
				StaticText In 2015, there were 8.7 million reported cases globally with 379,000 deaths​. Even with prompt diagnosis and treatment, 5% to 10% of patients die within 24 to 48 hours post symptom onset​​. Immediate treatment with antibiotics is crucial for recovery and averting severe complications​.
				StaticText The JIDDU platform, offering 1-hour antibiotic sensitivity testing, could dramatically shorten this critical time frame, thus enabling timely, effective treatment, and potentially increasing survival rates, and improving patient outcomes in meningitis and other severe infections.

				StaticText In the US, over 6.5 million individuals are impacted by infected wounds, a figure likely to rise due to antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, surgical site infections (SSIs) present another significant health challenge with a 1-2% incidence rate across all surgical procedures, translating to 1 in 24 surgical patients experiencing an SSI.
				StaticText Astek Diagnostics’ work in wound care management aims to address this issue by expediting the identification of bacterial infections and determining antibiotic sensitivity. The JIDDU system significantly reduces the time between wound swabbing and effective antibiotic treatment initiation. This swift action is pivotal in minimizing the severity of wound infections, including SSIs, and tackling antibiotic resistance, thus delivering better wound care outcomes.

			paragraph
				StaticText 1.7 million Americans encounter sepsis each year and 270,000 of those cases result in fatalities. Most of those outcomes are due to delayed diagnoses and incorrect antibiotic prescriptions. Around 22% of patients receive ineffective antibiotics, given the standard immediate broad-spectrum antibiotic administration.
				StaticText Current diagnostic methods like blood cultures entail prolonged waiting times, unsuitable for high-mortality conditions like sepsis. Astek Diagnostics addresses this with a novel diagnostic assay and an automated microfluidic platform which provides a bacteremia indication and patient-specific antibiotic recommendations within 1 hour. This innovation significantly reduces diagnostic time, thus ensuring timely and effective initiation of antibiotic treatment. The JIDDU system is poised to disrupt the sepsis diagnostic market, given its potential to reduce sepsis-related mortality rates.
