# Task

**User Story of Navigation Attempts**

As a curious web explorer user,
I navigate to various websites to learn and gather information,
so that I can enhance my knowledge and discover new resources.

**Success definition:** Given I start on the homepage of Bluebird's AI without any logged-in session
When I attempt to navigate to multiple websites, including 'httpswww.example.com' and 'httpswww.wikipedia.org'
Then I should see that the browser remains on the 'aboutblank' page, indicating that the navigation attempts did not succeed.

## Trajectory

**Step 1:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** Since the user story indicates that the user is curious about exploring different websites, initiating a navigation request to 'https://www.example.com' demonstrates the user's intent to learn and gather information. However, given the current state of the browser which is 'about:blank' and the implicit user story criteria indicating that the navigation should fail, I anticipate that this action will not result in a successful navigation to the website, as the browser remains on 'about:blank'. This aligns with the success criteria that specifies the navigation should not succeed.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its elements.

**Change Description:** The browser did not transition to the new URL 'https://www.example.com' as intended, remaining at 'about:blank' and retaining focus on the initial empty state.

**Step 2:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** My reasoning for this action is that it aligns with the userâ€™s intent to explore various websites as part of their knowledge-gathering process. By attempting to navigate to 'https://www.example.com', I'm following the user story while observing the expected outcome, which is that the browser should not successfully navigate away from 'about:blank'. This will help confirm whether the task's success criteria (the browser remaining on 'about:blank') are met, further validating the user's experience of trying to explore while not logged in.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Attempt to navigate to a sample website to explore its elements.

**Change Description:** The browser did not successfully navigate to 'https://www.example.com', as evidenced by the final state still showing 'about:blank' as the URL, indicating that no new web content was loaded.

**Step 3:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** My reasoning for this action is based on the user story, which involves navigating to external websites to gather information. However, given the success criteria indicates that the browser should remain on the 'about:blank' page, this action is a test to see if navigating will keep me on 'about:blank'. This will help determine if the connection to external sites is functioning as intended or if there are restrictions preventing navigation from happening.

**Action:** goto('https://www.wikipedia.org') # Navigate to Wikipedia to explore its elements.

**Change Description:** The browser attempted to navigate to 'https://www.wikipedia.org', but the URL remains 'about:blank' indicating that the navigation did not successfully occur.
