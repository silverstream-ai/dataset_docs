# Task

**Explore SuperSend Features**

As a marketing manager,
I explore the features of SuperSend,
so that I can determine how the platform can enhance our email outreach campaigns.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the SuperSend homepage and want to learn more about the product
When I click on the 'Features' link and then select the 'Optimization' tab
Then I should see the details about optimization features that improve campaign performance, including Inbox Rotation and Email AB Testing.

**Reasoning for action:** I selected the 'Product' link as it is the logical step to access detailed information about the features offered by SuperSend. This directly aligns with the user's goal of exploring the platform's capabilities related to their email outreach campaigns. By accessing this section, I can further narrow down the information relevant to optimization features, like Inbox Rotation and Email AB Testing, necessary for evaluating how the platform can improve their campaigns.

**Action:** click('104') # Click on the 'Product' link to explore the product features.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'Product' link, the browser navigated to the product section of the Super Send website at the URL 'https://supersend.io/#product'. The navigation links and layout updated accordingly, with the page now displaying product features and enhancements, while the initial state elements such as the focus position changed from a centered position to a more aligned position with the new content.

**Reasoning for action:** By clicking the 'Features' link, I directly access the part of the website that contains comprehensive information about what SuperSend offers. This is essential for the task because I need to understand the platform's capabilities for enhancing email outreach campaigns, meeting the user's goal of exploring product features.

It sets me up to find specific details about the optimization features, such as Inbox Rotation and Email AB Testing, which are necessary to evaluate how these tools can improve campaign performance.

**Action:** click('105') # Click on the 'Features' link to explore detailed product features.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'Features' link, the browser navigated from the 'Product' section to the 'Features' section of the Super Send website, updating the URL to 'https://supersend.io/#features' and shifting focus to the content related to product features, including detailed tabs for different functionalities like Automation, Reporting, and Analytics.
