# Task

**Explore Freterium Services and Schedule a Demo**

As a potential client,
I explore the Freterium services related to transport management and visibility solutions,
so that I can understand how their platform can improve my logistics operations and schedule a demo for further information.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Freterium homepage
When I click on the 'Next-gen TMS' link and then on the 'Connect your ecosystem' link, and finally on the 'Book a demo' link
Then I should see the scheduling interface for the demo and be able to select a date and time.

**Reasoning for action:** By clicking the 'Book a demo' link, I am taking a direct step towards fulfilling the user's goal of scheduling a demo to explore Freterium's transport management and visibility solutions. This action significantly advances the task as it leads to the demo scheduling page where the user can review available time slots and finalize the booking.

**Action:** click(57) # Click on the 'Book a demo' link to explore scheduling options.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'Book a demo' link, the browser navigated to a new URL displaying a Calendly iframe which allows users to select a date and time for scheduling a demo, replacing the previous content on the Freterium website.
