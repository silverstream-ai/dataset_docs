# Task

**Doctor Sign-Up Process**

As a prospective doctor wanting to join OpenClinic,
I complete the sign-up form,
so that I can quickly start practicing medicine through the platform and offer my services to patients.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the OpenClinic sign-up page and have started filling out the registration form
When I fill out my name, email address, state of practice, specialty area, and NPI number, and click the Sign Up button
Then I should receive a validation message about any incomplete fields that need to be filled before I can successfully sign up.

**Reasoning for action:** My reasoning for this action was that to complete the user's instruction of filling out the registration form, I need to access the specific page where this form is located. The link I clicked on labeled 'Doctor Sign-Up' should lead me directly to the place where I can provide my details and begin the sign-up process, thus achieving the user's goal of joining OpenClinic.

**Action:** click('75') # Click on the Doctor Sign-Up link to explore the sign-up process for doctors.

**Change Description:** Upon clicking the 'Doctor Sign-Up' link, the browser navigated to the 'Sign up' page, which is tailored for licensed doctors, featuring a new title, relevant prompts, and a form requiring information such as name, email, state licensing, specialty area, and NPI number, thus facilitating the doctor's registration process.

**Reasoning for action:** My reasoning for filling the registration fields with example data is to simulate the process of completing the sign-up form for a prospective doctor. By inputting a name, email address, state of practice, specialty area, and NPI number, I meet the basic requirements outlined in the user story. This action is critical as it prepares the form for final submission, and ensures I can test the subsequent validation message for any incomplete fields before actually signing up. Therefore, it directly advances the task by completing the necessary steps to fulfill the user's intention of signing up efficiently.

**Action:** fill('46', 'John Doe') # Fill in the Name field with an example name
fill('48', 'john.doe@example.com') # Fill in the Email Address field with an example email
fill('50', 'California') # Fill in the state(s) where licensed to practice
fill('52', 'Dermatology') # Fill in the specialty area
fill('54', '1234567890') # Fill in the NPI number

**Change Description:** The Name, Email Address, state of practice, specialty area, and NPI number fields in the sign-up form were filled with the values 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', 'California', 'Dermatology', and '1234567890' respectively, updating their content to reflect the provided inputs.

This action is critical because it initiates the process of validating the inputs provided by the user.

**Action:** click('56') # Click on the Sign Up button to submit the form.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'Sign Up' button, an alert was displayed indicating 'Please fill out this field,' indicating a validation requirement was not met, while the form fields remain unchanged and are still focused.
