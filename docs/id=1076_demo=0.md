# Task

**Explore Navigation Capabilities**

As a web explorer,
I navigate to various websites to learn about their content,
so that I can evaluate which resources are available for my research.

**Success definition:** Given I am on a blank page
When I attempt to navigate to 'httpswww.example.com' and 'httpswww.wikipedia.org'
Then I should be aware that the navigation did not succeed and the content remains unchanged.

## Trajectory

**Step 1:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** I initiated the navigation to 'https://www.example.com' to start the process of exploring the content of that website. This is the first step in fulfilling the user story of evaluating resources for research. However, the task states that the navigation should ultimately fail, and the content should remain unchanged, indicating that I need to be prepared to recognize whether the navigation succeeds or fails.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The navigation action was intended to change the URL to 'https://www.example.com', but the browser's URL remains 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation did not successfully complete.

**Step 2:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** By executing the goto command, I aimed to navigate to 'https://www.example.com' in order to access and assess its content. According to the user story, the intention is to explore various websites. However, based on the acceptance test criteria, this action should not result in a successful navigation, as shown by the current browser state 'about:blank'. Therefore, I would anticipate that the page should remain unchanged after this action.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser attempted to navigate to 'https://www.example.com', but the URL remained 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation did not succeed and the content of the webpage did not change.

**Step 3:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** The reasoning behind this action is that I need to explore the content available on the Wikipedia website as part of my research. By attempting to navigate to 'https://www.wikipedia.org', I'm executing the primary task which is accessing new resources. However, I must be aware that if the navigation fails and the current state remains unchanged (due to a possible formatting error in the URL), my exploration will be hindered. I'll need to confirm whether the navigation was successful or not after executing this command.

**Action:** goto('https://www.wikipedia.org') # Navigate to Wikipedia to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser's URL did not change from 'about:blank' despite the action to navigate to 'https://www.wikipedia.org', indicating that the navigation was likely unsuccessful or blocked, leaving the focus on the initial blank page.
