# Task

**User Story for Learning About Viv's Functionalities**

As a potential customer,
I learn more about Silogy and its AI verification engineer, Viv,
so that I can understand how Viv can improve my chip development and debugging processes.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Silogy homepage
When I click on the 'About Us' link and then on the 'Frequently Asked Questions' section
Then I should see detailed information about Silogy and Viv's capabilities, operations, and security features.

	heading Frequently Asked Questions
	heading What is Viv?
	paragraph
		StaticText Viv is our AI verification engineer and your new favorite coworker. They work around the clock to debug test failures using log files, code, and (soon) waveform files. Viv helps chip developers and verification engineers root-cause the source of bugs 10x faster by automating repetitive tasks and providing clues for why tests are failing.
	heading How does Viv work?
	paragraph
		StaticText Viv uses open source LLMs to debug failing test cases using a combination of log files, code, and (soon) waveform files. Viv can be hosted on-premise meaning all your data lives securely on your machines.
	heading Which simulators are supported?
	paragraph
		StaticText We support Synopsys VCS, Siemens QuestaSim, Verilator, and Vivado Simulator.
	heading How can Viv make chip developers more productive?
	paragraph
		StaticText Viv makes chip developers more productive by root-causing the source of test failures without human intervention. While Viv, like any verification engineer, may not always be right, they can provide suggestions for where bugs may be coming from, citing the code and waveforms directly.
	heading Can Viv be hosted on-premise?
	paragraph
		StaticText Yes. Viv can live on-premise so none of your data ever leaves your machines.
	heading How are tests run?
	paragraph
		StaticText Silogy provides a test runner that supports most commerical simulators.
	heading How secure is Silogy's platform?
	paragraph
		StaticText Security is a top concern for Silogy. In addition to the option for a fully on-premise deployment, we employ industry-leading security practices including encryption, access controls, and regular security audits and penetration testing to safeguard customer IP. We are in the process of getting SOC2 certification.

**Reasoning for action:** My reasoning for clicking on the 'Book a Demo' link is that it provides an opportunity for a more interactive and detailed understanding of Silogy and Viv's capabilities. While the FAQs contain valuable information, engaging in a demo might allow for real-time questions and explanations, thereby enhancing my comprehension of how Viv can specifically aid in improving chip development and debugging processes.

**Action:** click(51) # Click on the 'Book a Demo' link to explore the demo booking process.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'Book a Demo' link, the browser's state focused on the same link, indicating it was activated for further action. The layout and content of the page remained unchanged, but the focus on the link suggests readiness to proceed to the demo booking interface.
