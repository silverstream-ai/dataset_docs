# Task

**Website Navigation Exploration**

As a A curious web user,
I explore various websites,
so that I can find interesting content that meets my needs.

**Success definition:** Given I start from the homepage of QuackAI
When I attempt to navigate to different external websites such as Wikipedia and Google
Then I should see a message indicating that the navigation was unsuccessful and that I remain on the homepage of QuackAI.

## Trajectory

**Step 1:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** In this context, the user's goal is to find interesting content by exploring various websites. However, the success criteria dictate that an attempt to navigate must result in an unsuccessful message. By navigating to 'https://www.example.com', I can test if this principle holds true for the QuackAI homepage's navigation restrictions. If the navigation succeeds, I expect to see the error message, reinforcing that I remain on the homepage.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser attempted to navigate to 'https://www.example.com', but the URL remained 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation was unsuccessful and the page did not load.

**Step 2:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** The user's instruction is to explore external websites, while the acceptance test specifies that the browser should not successfully navigate away from the QuackAI homepage. Therefore, attempting to go to Wikipedia will demonstrate how the system reacts when the navigation fails and reinforces the need to stay on the homepage.

**Action:** goto('https://www.wikipedia.org') # Navigate to Wikipedia to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser's URL remains unchanged as 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation to 'https://www.wikipedia.org' was not successful or completed, and thus, the browser state remained focused on the blank page.

**Step 3:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** However, since the user story specifies that I should remain on the homepage of QuackAI and see a message indicating that the navigation was unsuccessful, taking this action contradicts that requirement. I should instead handle the navigation attempt by displaying a message that I cannot leave the homepage and maintain the user within the QuackAI site.

**Action:** goto('https://www.google.com') # Navigate to Google to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser's URL was intended to change to 'https://www.google.com', but the final state still shows 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation did not successfully complete.
