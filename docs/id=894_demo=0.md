# Task

**Explore Products and Industries**

As a business analyst,
I explore Versori's product offerings and how they apply across different industries,
so that I can evaluate how Versori's solutions can meet my organization's integration needs.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Versori homepage
When I click on the Products button
Then I should see the Products menu expanded and ready for selection

</details>

**Reasoning for action:** I clicked on the Products button (id 56) because the user story specifies that I need to explore Versori's product offerings. By clicking this button, I advance the task by triggering an event that will reveal a dropdown or expanded menu with details about the products, which is crucial for evaluating how their solutions meet my organization’s integration needs.

**Action:** click(56) # Click on the Products button to explore the product offerings.

**Change Description:** After clicking the Products button, its state changed to focused, remaining collapsed with a hasPopup attribute indicating that a menu is available for exploration. The overall content of the page remained the same, but the focus on the Products button suggests a user intent to view product offerings.
