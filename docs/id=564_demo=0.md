# Task

**Exploring Roe AI Blogs and Booking a Demo**

As a prospective client,
I explore the blog content to learn how Roe AI can help my business,
so that I can understand the benefits of the service better and schedule a demo session to see it in action.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Roe AI homepage and have accepted the cookie consent
When I click on the 'READ OUR BLOGS' link and select a blog post titled 'Case Study Keboola Streamlines Market Insights with Roe AI' and then click on the 'BOOK A DEMO SESSION' link
Then I should be taken to the blog post and be able to book a demo session for the Roe AI platform to explore it further.

			StaticText ‍
		StaticText Keboola, a leading provider of data operations solutions, empowers organizations to manage complex data workflows. With the rapid growth of the AI and data sectors, staying on top of new market trends and identifying emerging data companies had become a priority for Keboola. Their existing process, while functional, relied heavily on manual inputs and multiple tools, making it increasingly difficult to scale. As the industry evolved, Keboola realized that it needed a more streamlined, automated solution to enhance the efficiency of tracking and analyzing these trends.
	paragraph
		StaticText To ensure they could continue to lead the market with innovative solutions, Keboola needed a way to integrate insights from a variety of data sources—both structured and unstructured—without overcomplicating their workflow.
	heading ‍
	heading Problem
		strong
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText ‍
		StaticText The product and research teams at Keboola were using a variety of tools, including Slack, Notion, Make.com, OpenAI, and their own platform. This multi-tool system was effective but ultimately led to challenges in governance, observability, and cost monitoring. The use of so many disparate tools made it difficult to get a unified view of market movements, and monitoring total costs across the entire setup was nearly impossible. Moreover, existing AI tools for generating structured insights from unstructured data sources often produced inconsistent or unreliable results.
	paragraph
		StaticText While this approach worked, it was clear that as the volume and complexity of data increased, so too did the need for automation and more effective integration of insights into their workflows.

			StaticText ‍
		StaticText Keboola found the solution in Roe AI, integrating its robust unstructured data capabilities with their existing platform. Roe AI’s powerful data analysis tools were able to transform unstructured data—such as web pages, documents, and social media—into structured insights, providing a more reliable and consistent view of emerging trends. This automation allowed Keboola to continue using its existing infrastructure while reducing the number of tools involved in data collection and analysis.
	paragraph
		StaticText Roe AI enabled Keboola to query enriched, structured insights using familiar SQL interfaces, seamlessly blending with Keboola’s data workflows. By automating the data enrichment process, Roe AI allowed Keboola’s teams to focus on higher-level analysis rather than manual data tagging and processing.
