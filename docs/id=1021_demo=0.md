Concourse is built with the ability to reason through tasks, develop plans, and independently do work finance teams would otherwise have to do manually. With Concourse, finance teams are able to focus more on strategic priorities and spend time taking action instead of wrangling data and manipulating spreadsheets.

		paragraph
			StaticText Core to the platform is an AI analyst tailor-built for finance teams that is available at any hour of the day, accessible via natural language, and built with full connectivity to a company’s existing financial systems. It enables team members to more effectively retrieve and analyze data, generate charts and reports, and answer ad-hoc questions.

			StaticText Concourse can also be deployed into more complex finance workflows to take on discrete projects directly for teams. Concoure’s AI analyst has the ability to execute complex, multi-step operations and perform sophisticated mathematical calculations to create outputs that can immediately be used by the team.

		paragraph
			StaticText At Concourse we believe that software is going through a foundational transition in the way that it is being built, bought, and deployed within the enterprise.
		paragraph
			StaticText The advances in generative AI and large language models have created a world where software can now reason through problems, develop potential solutions, and directly execute tasks. This creates the opportunity for companies to work with (or hire) AI agents as functional team members that materially impact performance.
		paragraph
			StaticText AI agents enable teams to move faster, increase capacity, and create efficiencies by distributing work to the individual best suited to the job, human or agent. Employees can offload the most manual, error prone, and time consuming tasks to AI agents and focus their time on more impactful work. The value of software will now be measured in terms of increased output instead of employee productivity gains. Teams who fully embrace this shift will win.
		paragraph
			StaticText We believe that finance is the single most interesting vertical for the application of AI agents. Finance teams are essential to scaling and have immense impact on every major decision at successful companies. Yet, finance teams across companies of all sizes are bogged down by manual workflows and data manipulation, reducing their potential strategic impact.
		paragraph
			StaticText The status quo for finance is hundreds of point solutions that are cobbled together within the finance department. Excel continues to be the lowest common denominator across systems and data which limits the promise of automation within finance. No solution has yet to provide the leverage to change this dynamic.
		paragraph
			StaticText Concourse’s AI analyst can, for the first time, change the way finance teams interact with their data and fully eliminate their most painful and repetitive workflows.
		heading About Concourse.

			StaticText Concourse is built by industry experts – we’ve seen, managed, and scaled finance functions at many companies including unicorn startups and intimately understand the workflows and priorities finance teams face.

We also deeply understand AI and LLMs and are obsessed with bringing AI agents to life within the enterprise.

**Reasoning for action:** I filled in the first name, last name, company, email, and password fields sequentially. Each field corresponds to the expected input required for registration, as specified in the user story. By providing this information, I am advancing towards the goal of successfully completing the registration process. The specific details entered (like 'John' for first name and the format of the email) align with common expected inputs, ensuring they meet the likely validation rules that will follow, thus increasing the likelihood of a successful registration.

**Action:** fill(40, 'John') # Fill in the First Name
fill(43, 'Doe') # Fill in the Last Name
fill(46, 'Example Company') # Fill in the Company
fill(49, 'john.doe@example.com') # Fill in the Email
fill(54, 'Password123!') # Fill in the Password

**Change Description:** The agent filled in the First Name field with 'John', the Last Name field with 'Doe', the Company field with 'Example Company', the Email field with 'john.doe@example.com', and the Password field with 'Password123!', while the password input is now visually obscured. Additionally, the validation criteria for the password were updated to show checkmarks indicating that the entered password meets all complexity requirements.
