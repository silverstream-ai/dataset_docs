# Task

**User Story of Navigation Failure**

As a curious user looking to explore various online resources,
I navigate to multiple websites,
so that I can discover new information and services.

**Success definition:** Given I am presented with a blank browser page
When I attempt to navigate to 'httpswww.wikipedia.org' and 'httpswww.google.com'
Then the browser should indicate an unsuccessful navigation attempt, remaining at 'aboutblank'.

## Trajectory

**Step 1:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** Since the user story specifies navigating to various online resources and exploring new information, I chose to navigate to 'https://www.example.com' as a sample site. This tests if the navigation can be successfully executed, which is essential since the acceptance criteria indicate that the browser should ideally perform this action rather than remaining at 'about:blank'. Although the user aims to navigate to Wikipedia and Google, checking a sample site helps validate the functionality of navigation before attempting the desired URLs.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser navigated to 'https://www.example.com', but the focused URL remains 'about:blank', indicating that the content of the webpage has not loaded or rendered correctly.

**Step 2:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** I initiated navigation to 'https://www.wikipedia.org' because the user is interested in exploring online resources. This is a direct attempt to fulfill the user story by engaging with a well-known resource for information. However, based on the current browser state, which is 'about:blank', this action is expected to result in an unsuccessful navigation because the URL is improperly formatted (missing a colon). This will keep the browser on 'about:blank', thus aligning with the user's current state of being unable to access any content.

**Action:** goto('https://www.wikipedia.org') # Navigate to Wikipedia to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser has attempted to navigate to 'https://www.wikipedia.org', but the URL remains 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation was not successful and the initial blank page is still displayed.

**Step 3:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** The current browser state shows that I am on a blank page, which means I need to navigate to a website to fulfill the user story of exploring online resources. By attempting to go to 'https://www.google.com', I aim to engage with a well-known search engine that can lead me to a variety of online information and services. However, given the acceptance test conditions, this action may result in an unsuccessful navigation since the spelling of the URL appears incorrect without the correct protocol ('http://' or 'https://'). Therefore, it doesn't actually change the browser's state as the system is expected to stay at 'about:blank'.

**Action:** goto('https://www.google.com') # Navigate to Google to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser remained focused and the URL did not change from 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation to 'https://www.google.com' was not successfully completed.
