# Task

**User Story for Browser Navigation Issue**

As a web user,
I navigate to a sample website and explore its content,
so that I can access information and resources available on the site.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the browser starting from 'aboutblank'
When I attempt to navigate to 'httpswww.example.com' three times
Then I should remain on 'aboutblank' without successful navigation to the sample website.

## Trajectory

**Step 1:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** I initiated a navigation to 'https://www.example.com' to explore the content of the site. However, according to the acceptance criteria, I should remain on 'about:blank' without successful navigation. Therefore, I need to verify that despite this navigation action, I stay on the original page as specified.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser initiated a navigation action to 'https://www.example.com', but the final state indicates that the URL remains 'about:blank', suggesting that the navigation did not successfully load the new webpage.

**Step 2:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** Since the current browser state is at 'about:blank', executing the goto command will initiate a navigation request to 'https://www.example.com'. However, to achieve the user story's goal of remaining on 'about:blank' without successful navigation, I need to consider the browser's behavior. The intended task specifies that I should not change my location from 'about:blank'. Therefore, this action will not meet the acceptance criteria since it leads to a navigation attempt, which contradicts the requirement to stay on 'about:blank'.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser remained focused on the 'about:blank' page, indicating that the navigation to 'https://www.example.com' did not successfully load, and thus no changes occurred in the browser state.

**Step 3:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** Since the user story requires me to navigate to the sample website three times, I performed the first action of attempting to go to 'https://www.example.com'. However, according to the success criteria, even though I've executed the navigation command, it intends for my ultimate state to remain on 'about:blank'. This contradiction implies that despite my action, the browser would not successfully redirect to the new URL, and I would continue to remain on 'about:blank'. Thus, my action aligns with the user's intent for the testing scenario.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its content.

**Change Description:** Although the action took place to navigate to 'https://www.example.com', there was no change in the browser's URL from 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation did not occur successfully.
