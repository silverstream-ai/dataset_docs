# Task

**Book a Demo Scheduling User Story**

As a prospective customer,
I book a demo for Kobalt Labs' services,
so that I can evaluate how their solution can help my team with risk and compliance management.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Kobalt Labs website
When I click on the 'Book Demo' link and select January 13, 2025, at 300pm as my desired time slot
Then I should be able to successfully schedule a demo for that time and see a confirmation of my appointment.

**Reasoning for action:** I clicked on the 3:00pm time slot (identified by the element with ID 422) because this is the specific time that the user indicated as their desired time for the demo. By selecting this time, I am advancing the task of scheduling the demo appointment, which moves me closer to confirming the booking.

**Action:** click(422) # Click on the 3:00pm time slot to proceed with the booking.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 3:00pm time slot to proceed with the booking, the button for 3:00pm became disabled, indicating that it is no longer selectable, while the other available time slots remain enabled for selection.
