# Task

**User Sign-Up for Early Access**

As a mental health professional,
I sign up for early access to the Orchid platform,
so that I can explore its features and tools that will enhance my practice and patient management.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Orchid landing page and I have not previously signed up for early access
When I fill in my email address and click the 'Get Early Access' button
Then I should be redirected to a scheduling page for a 30-minute walkthrough with my email pre-filled

**Reasoning for action:** I clicked on the email input field to bring the cursor into that field. This action is necessary because the next step requires me to fill in my email address. By focusing on the input, I ensure that I can type my information correctly and proceed to the next step without any distractions or issues.

**Action:** click('56') # Click on the email input field to focus on it.

**Change Description:** The email input field is now focused, allowing the user to enter their email address, while maintaining its required status for submission.

**Reasoning for action:** I reasoned that filling in the email field is necessary to complete the user's objective of signing up for early access. By providing an email address, the form can be submitted, leading to the next step of the process, which is being redirected to the scheduling page for a walkthrough, which is a critical part of accessing the platform's features.

**Action:** fill('56', 'test@example.com') # Fill the email input field with a sample email address.

**Change Description:** The email input field has been filled with the sample email address 'test@example.com', changing its value from empty to 'test@example.com'.

**Reasoning for action:** I clicked on the 'Get Early Access' button because this action directly aligns with the user's goal of signing up for early access to the Orchid platform. By submitting my email, I am indicating my interest in exploring the platform's features, and I expect to be redirected to the next step, which is the scheduling page for a walkthrough, as specified in the acceptance test.

**Action:** click('57') # Click on the 'Get Early Access' button to submit the email.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'Get Early Access' button, the browser navigated to a Calendly page for scheduling a 30-minute walkthrough, displaying a calendar for selecting a date and time, and automatically filled the email field with 'test@example.com'.
