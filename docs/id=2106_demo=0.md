# Task

**User Onboarding Process**

As a new restaurant owner,
I complete the initial onboarding form,
so that I can start using the Avocado POS system to manage my business effectively.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Avocado POS 'Get Started' page
When I fill in my name and proceed through the onboarding form
Then I should be able to successfully enter my restaurant name in the next question and see the progress updated.

**Reasoning for action:** I selected the 'Get Started' link because it is the entry point for new users like me who want to begin onboarding. This action progresses towards the goal of filling out the necessary initial information for using the Avocado POS system effectively.

**Action:** click(85) # Click on the 'Get Started' button to explore the options for new users.

**Change Description:** The browser transitioned from the Avocado POS website to the Instamenu Signup Form, initiated by clicking the 'Get Started' button. The new form now presents the user with a required question asking for their first name, indicating the beginning of a sign-up process.

**Reasoning for action:** I identified that the first question in the onboarding form requires the user to input their first name to move forward. By filling in the text box with 'John Doe', I meet the requirement, which is necessary to unlock the subsequent question in the form. This progresses the user through the onboarding process, bringing them closer to successfully setting up their restaurant in the Avocado POS system.

**Action:** fill(115, 'John Doe') # Fill in the textbox with a sample name 'John Doe'.

**Change Description:** The textbox for the first name was filled with the value 'John Doe', prompting a change in the form's progress value to approximately 16.67%, indicating that the user has made progress in completing the form.

**Reasoning for action:** I needed to progress through the onboarding form after entering my first name. By clicking the 'OK' button, it allows the system to save my response and ensures that I can proceed to the next question where I will enter my restaurant name. This step is crucial to ensure that I can complete the onboarding process and effectively start using the Avocado POS system.

**Action:** click(122) # Click on the 'OK' button to proceed to the next question.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'OK' button, the form progressed from Question 1 to Question 2, changing the displayed question from 'Hello! ðŸ‘‹ What is your first name?' to 'What is the name of your restaurant?', while updating the textbox to reflect the new question.
