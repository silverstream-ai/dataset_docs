# Task

**Explore Mass Payments Product and Pricing**

As a business owner,
I explore the Mass Payments product and its pricing,
so that I can determine if it meets my company's needs for making payments to multiple vendors efficiently.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Levro homepage
When I click on the Product button, then click on the Mass Payments link, followed by viewing the Pricing details
Then I should see the Mass Payments product features and the corresponding pricing details displayed.

**Reasoning for action:** By clicking on the Product button (element 45), I trigger the dropdown menu that contains links to various product offerings from Levro. This step is essential to navigate to the specific Mass Payments product information needed to see if it meets the user's needs for making payments to multiple vendors. Without this action, accessing the Mass Payments product would not be possible.

**Action:** click(45) # Click on the Product button to explore product offerings.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'Product' button, the navigation menu expanded to display additional links related to product offerings, including 'Overview', 'Mass Payments', 'Tax Compliance', 'Global Payment API', 'Global Payouts', and 'Integrations', which were not visible in the initial browser state.

**Reasoning for action:** By clicking on the 'View Pricing' link, I effectively move from the general overview of the Mass Payments product to a more specific page detailing the pricing structure. This directly aligns with the user's goal of exploring the Mass Payments product and its pricing, allowing them to assess whether the service meets their company's needs for making payments to multiple vendors efficiently.

**Action:** click(99) # Click on the View Pricing link to explore the pricing details for the Mass Payments service.

**Change Description:** The browser navigated from the 'Mass Payments' page to the 'Pricing' page of the Levro website after the user clicked on the 'View Pricing' link, resulting in the new page displaying pricing details and various plans related to the payment services.
