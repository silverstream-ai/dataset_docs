# Task

**Explore ByteCheck and Schedule a Demo**

As a restaurant owner,
I learn more about ByteCheck's features and schedule a demo,
so that I can improve my restaurant operations and understand how ByteCheck can benefit my business.

**Success definition:** Given I am a restaurant owner visiting the Byte Kitchen website
When I explore the ByteCheck section and click on the 'Learn More' button
Then I should see informative details about ByteCheck's benefits and features for my business, and I should be able to click on the 'Schedule Demo' button and navigate to the demo request page.

**Reasoning for action:** By clicking on the 'Schedule Demo' button, I am directly aligning with the user story's requirement to allow the restaurant owner to arrange a demo for ByteCheck. This action progresses the task by potentially leading to a page where the user can provide relevant information to schedule a demo, thereby enhancing their understanding of how ByteCheck can improve their restaurant operations.

**Action:** click(48) # Click on the Schedule Demo button to explore how to arrange a demo for ByteCheck.

**Change Description:** The browser navigated from the ByteCheck page to the Byte Kitchen Demo page after clicking the 'Schedule Demo' button, revealing a new form for demo requests along with introductory text inviting users to sign up for a free pilot.
