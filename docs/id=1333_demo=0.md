# Task

**Sample Website Navigation User Story**

As a A curious internet user,
I explore different websites and their content,
so that I can gather information and evaluate various services and offerings.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the browser's homepage
When I try to access 'httpswww.example.com' multiple times
Then I should not see any change in the URL or content, indicating that the navigation did not succeed.

## Trajectory

**Step 1:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** My reasoning for this action is to test the navigation to the specified URL, which is a part of the user's exploration task. By executing this command, I can observe whether the navigation to 'https://www.example.com' is successful or if there is a failure that leaves the URL unchanged and the content unaltered. This step directly relates to the user story by facilitating access to new content, aligning with the task of gathering information.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser attempted to navigate to 'https://www.example.com', but the URL remained unchanged as 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation did not complete successfully or was not reflected in the state.

**Step 2:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** I initiated the navigation to 'https://www.example.com' to fulfill the user story of exploring different websites. This action attempts to change the current state from 'about:blank' to the specified URL, thereby enabling the possibility to gather information, which aligns with the user's goal of exploring content on various services.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser performed a navigation action to 'https://www.example.com', but the current focus remained on 'about:blank', indicating that the new page did not render or was not accessible before the focus was updated.

**Step 3:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** Since the user story indicates an exploration of different websites, I need to attempt to access 'https://www.example.com' in order to gather information. The current state of the browser shows that I am on 'about:blank', so by using the goto command, I am initiating a navigation action. This is essential because it will allow me to determine if the site is accessible and if any content can be gathered for evaluation. If the navigation is unsuccessful, I will be able to observe that there is no change in the URL or content, aligning with the acceptance criteria.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its content.

**Change Description:** The browser initiated a navigation action to 'https://www.example.com', but the final state still shows the URL as 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation did not succeed and the content of the browser remained unchanged.
