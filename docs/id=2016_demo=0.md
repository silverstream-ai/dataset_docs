# Task

**Exploring Estimating Features**

As a construction manager,
I explore the product offerings of the estimating tool,
so that I can understand how to create accurate and detailed estimates quickly using Bolster.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Bolster Built homepage and can see the navigation menu
When I click on the Product button and then select the Estimating link
Then I should be redirected to the Estimates page where I can view features and benefits of the estimating tool, such as pre-built assemblies and AutoCost.
