# Task

**Explore Pointwise Services**

As a potential customer,
I explore the services offered by Pointwise,
so that I can understand how it can benefit me in managing my credit card rewards.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Pointwise homepage
When I click on the 'What we do' link, then click on the 'How it works' link, and finally click on the 'FAQs' link
Then I should see the 'How it works' section clearly explaining the functionality of Pointwise and the 'FAQs' section addressing common queries about the service.
