	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		StaticText “What changes did we make on Meta last week and what was its effect?”
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		StaticText Sounds easy, right?
	paragraph
		StaticText When she asked the same question on GetCrux 6 months ago, the system went haywire.
	paragraph
		StaticText What looked like a simple data fetch, brought out an entirely new aspect of AI agents.
	paragraph
	heading What happens behind the scenes of AI agents?
		strong
	paragraph
		StaticText Here’s what a typical process would look like:
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText Step 1
		StaticText : Decide what data to fetch based on the question + relevant context + what is available
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText Step 2
		StaticText : Use RAG to gather relevant data and make one or multiple LLM calls to answer the question
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText Step 3
		StaticText : Synthesize and display the output to the user
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		StaticText But what happens with the data to be fetched is too large? I’m talking GBs.
	paragraph
		StaticText The system falls apart!
	paragraph
		StaticText Either it starts:
	paragraph
		StaticText 1. Missing out relevant data and/or
	paragraph
		StaticText 2. Picking up irrelevant data
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		StaticText After breaking our heads at it for days and trying countless things, we realised:
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		StaticText The answer was surprisingly simple: Only fetch the data you REALLY need. But how do you do that?
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	heading The Multi-Agent Framework:
		strong
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	heading The task:
	paragraph
		StaticText Give our RAG a layer of intelligence with which it can understand and retrieve the relevant information in context of the question asked in real time.
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		StaticText We went ahead and designed a simultaneous multi-agentic structure of AI agents which would run in the background breaking down the process step by step where each agent handled the end-to-end completion of the task in the process.

			StaticText Multi-agentic Framework
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		StaticText Below are the agents that handled each task of the process at once to deliver the context of data retrieval in real time.
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	heading 1. Context Agent: The only work of this agent was to understand the question completely without further input from the user.some text.
	list
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Intent classification - First step is to understand the question and classify intent based on the team’s objectives & constraints.
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Data requirement identification - Next step was to make an exhausted list of data requirements for catering the intent and answer the question.
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Priority assignment - Amongst those listed, the next step for the agent was to prioritise the requirements for the next agent to do its job.
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	heading 2. Performance Metrics Agent: This agent takes the requirements from the Context Agent and finds the relevant data from the database.
	list
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Source mapping - The agent starts with finding the location of data in the database and maps to the list. Consider getting a list of people and writing their address in front of them from the address book.
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Access optimization - The agent then finds the best way to access the data effectively. Similar to making a route so that all addresses come on that route saving time for revisiting the already visited colony.
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Real-time validation - Validation for correct data is done as the last process.
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	heading 3. Action Classification Agent: The agent that actually executes everything.
	list
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Fetch orchestration - All data from the mapped source is then fetched.
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Data validation
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Response compilation - And then compile all the data after validation and get it ready to send it to LLM along with the question and context for output.
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	heading How this works in real-time:
		strong
	paragraph
		StaticText Going back to the question Michelle asked GetCrux:
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText “What changes did we make on Meta last week and what was its effect?”
		StaticText ,
	paragraph
		StaticText Let’s break down what actually happened behind the scenes.
	paragraph
		StaticText When the question got asked, the agents started working simultaneously -
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText Context Agent
		StaticText - figures out the right context required to come up with a response based on the team’s objectives & constraints.
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText For example:
		StaticText To know the effects of change in the campaigns, following are the relevant data points -
	paragraph
		StaticText 1. Last week’s action history
	paragraph
		StaticText 2. List of ads launched
	paragraph
		StaticText 3. Performance metrics
	paragraph
		StaticText 4. Revenue data from Shopify/Salesforce
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText Performance Metrics Agent
		StaticText - figures out which metrics are needed to answer the question, the period in the discussion, and the level i.e. campaign, Ad set, & Ad.
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText For example:
		StaticText Following metrics might be relevant to the query -
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText Performance Metrics:

		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Average order value
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Total revenue attributed to campaigns
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText Action Classification Agent
		StaticText - Classifies all actions taken into various types (ads introduced, budget changed, campaigns created, etc.) and selects the one we are interested in as per the query deciphered by the previous agents.
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	heading How the future of AI Agents is evolving:
		strong
	paragraph
		StaticText We still have a long way to go in terms of making the AI agents reliable and robust.
	paragraph
		StaticText Here are some of the challenges we are working on:
	paragraph
		StaticText 1. More Complicated Data Sources: Videos are already the most consumed format of content and with upcoming text-to-video models, this trend will only continue to grow. The question for us is - how do we keep up with this speed and make it easier to analyse videos on-the-go.
	paragraph
		StaticText 2. Smarter Decision Frameworks: Real-life decisions can hardly be captured in rule-based mechanisms. We experimented with
		link Keyword Analysis, url='https://www.getcrux.ai/blog/how-getcrux-saved-1-1m-in-google-search-ads-wastage-for-a-us-fintech-giant'
			strong
		StaticText , where a lot of human-biased decisions are made due to lack of context despite great tools being out there, and we were able to identify $19.8M+ worth of potential revenue through the exercise.
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		StaticText But the question is still unanswered - Can the AI agents work with ambiguity and new situations with the same level of reasoning and rigour?
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		StaticText While we keep experimenting with a lot of ideas, if you think a lot about AI’s application in your organisation, we’d like to

	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		StaticText “What changes did we make on Meta last week and what was its effect?”
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		StaticText Sounds easy, right?
	paragraph
		StaticText When she asked the same question on GetCrux 6 months ago, the system went haywire.
	paragraph
		StaticText What looked like a simple data fetch, brought out an entirely new aspect of AI agents.
	paragraph
	heading What happens behind the scenes of AI agents?
		strong
	paragraph
		StaticText Here’s what a typical process would look like:
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText Step 1
		StaticText : Decide what data to fetch based on the question + relevant context + what is available
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText Step 2
		StaticText : Use RAG to gather relevant data and make one or multiple LLM calls to answer the question
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText Step 3
		StaticText : Synthesize and display the output to the user
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		StaticText But what happens with the data to be fetched is too large? I’m talking GBs.
	paragraph
		StaticText The system falls apart!
	paragraph
		StaticText Either it starts:
	paragraph
		StaticText 1. Missing out relevant data and/or
	paragraph
		StaticText 2. Picking up irrelevant data
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		StaticText After breaking our heads at it for days and trying countless things, we realised:
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		StaticText The answer was surprisingly simple: Only fetch the data you REALLY need. But how do you do that?
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	heading The Multi-Agent Framework:
		strong
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	heading The task:
	paragraph
		StaticText Give our RAG a layer of intelligence with which it can understand and retrieve the relevant information in context of the question asked in real time.
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		StaticText We went ahead and designed a simultaneous multi-agentic structure of AI agents which would run in the background breaking down the process step by step where each agent handled the end-to-end completion of the task in the process.

	paragraph
		StaticText Below are the agents that handled each task of the process at once to deliver the context of data retrieval in real time.
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	heading 1. Context Agent: The only work of this agent was to understand the question completely without further input from the user.some text.
	list
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Intent classification - First step is to understand the question and classify intent based on the team’s objectives & constraints.
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Data requirement identification - Next step was to make an exhausted list of data requirements for catering the intent and answer the question.
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Priority assignment - Amongst those listed, the next step for the agent was to prioritise the requirements for the next agent to do its job.
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	heading 2. Performance Metrics Agent: This agent takes the requirements from the Context Agent and finds the relevant data from the database.
	list
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Source mapping - The agent starts with finding the location of data in the database and maps to the list. Consider getting a list of people and writing their address in front of them from the address book.
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Access optimization - The agent then finds the best way to access the data effectively. Similar to making a route so that all addresses come on that route saving time for revisiting the already visited colony.
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Real-time validation - Validation for correct data is done as the last process.
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	heading 3. Action Classification Agent: The agent that actually executes everything.
	list
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Fetch orchestration - All data from the mapped source is then fetched.
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Data validation
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Response compilation - And then compile all the data after validation and get it ready to send it to LLM along with the question and context for output.
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	heading How this works in real-time:
		strong
	paragraph
		StaticText Going back to the question Michelle asked GetCrux:
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText “What changes did we make on Meta last week and what was its effect?”
		StaticText ,
	paragraph
		StaticText Let’s break down what actually happened behind the scenes.
	paragraph
		StaticText When the question got asked, the agents started working simultaneously -
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText Context Agent
		StaticText - figures out the right context required to come up with a response based on the team’s objectives & constraints.
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText For example:
		StaticText To know the effects of change in the campaigns, following are the relevant data points -
	paragraph
		StaticText 1. Last week’s action history
	paragraph
		StaticText 2. List of ads launched
	paragraph
		StaticText 3. Performance metrics
	paragraph
		StaticText 4. Revenue data from Shopify/Salesforce
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText Performance Metrics Agent
		StaticText - figures out which metrics are needed to answer the question, the period in the discussion, and the level i.e. campaign, Ad set, & Ad.
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText For example:
		StaticText Following metrics might be relevant to the query -
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText Performance Metrics:
	list
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Click-through rate (CTR)
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Conversion rate
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Cost per click (CPC)
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Cost per acquisition (CPA)
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Impression share
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Engagement rate
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText Revenue Metrics:
	list
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Revenue per ad
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Return on ad spend (ROAS)
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Average order value
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Total revenue attributed to campaigns
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText Action Classification Agent
		StaticText - Classifies all actions taken into various types (ads introduced, budget changed, campaigns created, etc.) and selects the one we are interested in as per the query deciphered by the previous agents.
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	heading How the future of AI Agents is evolving:
		strong
	paragraph
		StaticText We still have a long way to go in terms of making the AI agents reliable and robust.
	paragraph
		StaticText Here are some of the challenges we are working on:
	paragraph
		StaticText 1. More Complicated Data Sources: Videos are already the most consumed format of content and with upcoming text-to-video models, this trend will only continue to grow. The question for us is - how do we keep up with this speed and make it easier to analyse videos on-the-go.
	paragraph
		StaticText 2. Smarter Decision Frameworks: Real-life decisions can hardly be captured in rule-based mechanisms. We experimented with
		link Keyword Analysis, url='https://www.getcrux.ai/blog/how-getcrux-saved-1-1m-in-google-search-ads-wastage-for-a-us-fintech-giant'
			strong
		StaticText , where a lot of human-biased decisions are made due to lack of context despite great tools being out there, and we were able to identify $19.8M+ worth of potential revenue through the exercise.
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		StaticText But the question is still unanswered - Can the AI agents work with ambiguity and new situations with the same level of reasoning and rigour?
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		StaticText While we keep experimenting with a lot of ideas, if you think a lot about AI’s application in your organisation, we’d like to

		StaticText The system falls apart!

		StaticText Below are the agents that handled each task of the process at once to deliver the context of data retrieval in real time.
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	heading 1. Context Agent: The only work of this agent was to understand the question completely without further input from the user.some text.
	list
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Intent classification - First step is to understand the question and classify intent based on the team’s objectives & constraints.
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Data requirement identification - Next step was to make an exhausted list of data requirements for catering the intent and answer the question.
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Priority assignment - Amongst those listed, the next step for the agent was to prioritise the requirements for the next agent to do its job.
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	heading 2. Performance Metrics Agent: This agent takes the requirements from the Context Agent and finds the relevant data from the database.
	list
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Source mapping - The agent starts with finding the location of data in the database and maps to the list. Consider getting a list of people and writing their address in front of them from the address book.
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Access optimization - The agent then finds the best way to access the data effectively. Similar to making a route so that all addresses come on that route saving time for revisiting the already visited colony.
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Real-time validation - Validation for correct data is done as the last process.
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	heading 3. Action Classification Agent: The agent that actually executes everything.
	list
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Fetch orchestration - All data from the mapped source is then fetched.
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Data validation
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Response compilation - And then compile all the data after validation and get it ready to send it to LLM along with the question and context for output.

		StaticText Going back to the question Michelle asked GetCrux:

		strong
			StaticText “What changes did we make on Meta last week and what was its effect?”
		StaticText ,
	paragraph
		StaticText Let’s break down what actually happened behind the scenes.
	paragraph
		StaticText When the question got asked, the agents started working simultaneously -
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText Context Agent
		StaticText - figures out the right context required to come up with a response based on the team’s objectives & constraints.
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText For example:
		StaticText To know the effects of change in the campaigns, following are the relevant data points -
	paragraph
		StaticText 1. Last week’s action history
	paragraph
		StaticText 2. List of ads launched
	paragraph
		StaticText 3. Performance metrics
	paragraph
		StaticText 4. Revenue data from Shopify/Salesforce
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText Performance Metrics Agent
		StaticText - figures out which metrics are needed to answer the question, the period in the discussion, and the level i.e. campaign, Ad set, & Ad.
	paragraph
		strong
			StaticText For example:
		StaticText Following metrics might be relevant to the query -

			ListMarker •
			StaticText Return on ad spend (ROAS)

			ListMarker •
			StaticText Average order value
		listitem
			ListMarker •
			StaticText Total revenue attributed to campaigns

		StaticText ‍
	paragraph

			StaticText Action Classification Agent
		StaticText - Classifies all actions taken into various types (ads introduced, budget changed, campaigns created, etc.) and selects the one we are interested in as per the query deciphered by the previous agents.

	heading How the future of AI Agents is evolving:
		strong
	paragraph
		StaticText We still have a long way to go in terms of making the AI agents reliable and robust.
	paragraph
		StaticText Here are some of the challenges we are working on:
	paragraph
		StaticText 1. More Complicated Data Sources: Videos are already the most consumed format of content and with upcoming text-to-video models, this trend will only continue to grow. The question for us is - how do we keep up with this speed and make it easier to analyse videos on-the-go.
	paragraph
		StaticText 2. Smarter Decision Frameworks: Real-life decisions can hardly be captured in rule-based mechanisms. We experimented with

			strong
		StaticText , where a lot of human-biased decisions are made due to lack of context despite great tools being out there, and we were able to identify $19.8M+ worth of potential revenue through the exercise.
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		StaticText But the question is still unanswered - Can the AI agents work with ambiguity and new situations with the same level of reasoning and rigour?
	paragraph
		StaticText ‍
	paragraph
		StaticText While we keep experimenting with a lot of ideas, if you think a lot about AI’s application in your organisation, we’d like to
