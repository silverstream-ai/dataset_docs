**Reasoning for action:** I clicked on the 'Join Beta' link because it is necessary to initiate the process of joining the closed beta program for Fetchr. This link directs me to the sign-up form where I can provide my personal details, which is essential for completing the user story. By taking this action, I am progressing towards filling out the required information, which is a critical step in successfully joining the beta program.

**Action:** click('44') # Click on the 'Join Beta' link to explore further.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'Join Beta' link, the browser navigated to a new form page where users are prompted to provide their information for the waitlist, including fields for first name, last name, phone number, and email, instead of the original overview of the Fetchr service.

**Reasoning for action:** Each 'fill' action corresponds to inputting data into the respective required fields on the Fetchr beta registration form. By entering 'Jane' in the first name field (ID '115'), 'Smith' in the last name field (ID '121'), '2015550123' in the phone number field (ID '328'), and 'jane@example.com' in the email address field (ID '334'), I am ensuring that all mandatory information required to successfully join the beta program is provided. This aligns with the user story of gaining access to Fetchr's closed beta by fulfilling the registration criteria.

**Action:** fill('115', 'Jane') # Fill in the first name
fill('121', 'Smith') # Fill in the last name
fill('328', '2015550123') # Fill in the phone number
fill('334', 'jane@example.com') # Fill in the email address

**Change Description:** The form progress increased from 0 to 50, and the input fields for first name, last name, phone number, and email address were filled with the values 'Jane', 'Smith', '(201) 555-0123', and 'jane@example.com' respectively, resulting in the display of these values in the corresponding textboxes.

**Reasoning for action:** I decided to click on the 'OK' button to submit the form because this is the next logical step in the process of joining the Fetchr closed beta. The form contains all the required fields filled out with valid information, so clicking the button is necessary to proceed to the next stage and check for any missing information or validation alerts. By doing this, I aim to fulfill the user's goal of joining the beta program and ensure that they receive personalized clothing suggestions.

**Action:** click('341') # Click on the 'OK' button to submit the form.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'OK' button, an alert message was displayed stating 'Please fill this in', indicating that some required fields were not completed, while the state of the previously filled inputs remained unchanged.
