# Task

**Explore Sample Website User Journey**

As a web explorer,
I navigate to various websites,
so that I can assess their elements and functionalities for a project I am researching.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the webpage 'httpscocrafter.com'
When I try to navigate to 'httpswww.example.com'
Then I should see my current webpage stay on 'aboutblank' with no new content loaded, indicating that the navigation failed.

## Trajectory

**Step 1:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** I am trying to fulfill the user story by initiating a navigation request to 'https://www.example.com'. However, the user story indicates that navigation should fail and the current webpage should remain as 'about:blank'. Therefore, I need to evaluate why the navigation might not succeed according to the success criteria.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its elements.

**Change Description:** The browser initiated navigation to 'https://www.example.com', but it maintained the initial state with 'url=about:blank', indicating that the page did not load successfully or the focus remained unchanged on the blank page.

**Step 2:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** When I executed the goto command, I anticipated it would change the webpage to the new URL 'https://www.example.com'. However, per the user story requirements, the task specifies that I should remain on 'about:blank' and see no new content loaded, which would indicate a failure of navigation. By performing the action to navigate, I am inadvertently attempting to change the current state, which contradicts the acceptance test criteria that the current webpage should remain unchanged.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its elements.

**Change Description:** The browser did not successfully navigate to 'https://www.example.com', as the URL remains 'about:blank', indicating that no new webpage was loaded or displayed.

**Step 3:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** Since the current browser state indicates that I am on 'about:blank', navigating to 'https://www.example.com' is intended to test the navigation functionality. However, according to the user story's success criteria, the navigation should fail, and I should remain on 'about:blank' with no new content loaded. This is crucial for verifying that my navigation functionality does not allow loading a new page from the empty state.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its elements.

**Change Description:** After attempting to navigate to 'https://www.example.com', the URL remains 'about:blank' and the focus state of the browser has not changed, indicating that the navigation did not successfully load the new website.
