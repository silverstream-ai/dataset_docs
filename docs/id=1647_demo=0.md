# Task

**Booking a Demo Meeting with Nyckel**

As a potential customer exploring AI solutions,
I book a demo meeting to learn more about Nyckel's offerings,
so that I can evaluate how their machine learning models can benefit my business.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the Nyckel homepage and I see the BOOK DEMO button
When I click the BOOK DEMO button, select January 8th, and choose the available time slot of 400 pm
Then I should be directed to a confirmation form for my demo meeting on January 8th at 400 pm with fields to enter my personal information.

**Reasoning for action:** By clicking the 'BOOK DEMO' button, I initiate the process of scheduling a demo meeting. This step is crucial as it leads me to the next stage where I can select the date and time for the demo, which is part of the task to book a meeting on January 8th at 4:00 PM. This action moves me closer to fulfilling the user's goal to evaluate Nyckel's machine learning models.

**Action:** click('160') # Click on the BOOK DEMO button to explore the demo booking process.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'BOOK DEMO' button, the browser navigated to a new page titled 'Intro Chat with Nyckel', which presents a booking interface for selecting a date and time for a demo. The previous content was replaced with a calendar overview for January 2025, indicators for step progression, and options for selecting time blocks, significantly altering the functionality and layout of the browser's current view.
