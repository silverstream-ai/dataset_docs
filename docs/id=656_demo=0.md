# Task

**Password Recovery Process**

As a user who forgot their password,
I recover my password,
so that I can regain access to my account quickly and easily.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the password recovery page after clicking 'Forgot your password?'
When I enter my email address and click 'Send Reset Email'
Then I should see a confirmation message indicating that a password reset email has been sent to 'user@example.com'.

**Reasoning for action:** To begin the password recovery process, I need to navigate to the Login page first because that is where the password recovery option is typically located. By clicking the 'Login' link, I can access the interface that allows users to request a password reset, which directly contributes to the user's need of recovering their password.

**Action:** click(106) # Click on the Login link to explore the login functionality.

**Change Description:** The browser's state changed from displaying the homepage of the AI-Moderated Research Platform to the login page, which now requires users to enter their email and password to access their accounts. Additionally, options for logging in with Google and recovering a forgotten password were added in this new state.

**Reasoning for action:** By clicking on the 'Forgot your password?' link, I am initiating the process to recover the user's password. This step is essential as it redirects me to the appropriate page that allows me to enter the email address associated with the account for password recovery. Without this action, I cannot proceed with sending the password reset email, which is crucial for the user to regain access to their account.

**Action:** click(99) # Click on the 'Forgot your password?' link to explore password recovery options.

**Change Description:** After clicking the 'Forgot your password?' link, the browser navigated to the password recovery page at 'https://outset.ai/forgot-password', updating the content to prompt the user to enter their email for a password reset, and changing the available button from 'Login' to 'Send Reset Email'.

**Reasoning for action:** I filled in the email textbox with 'user@example.com' to provide a valid email address that will receive the password reset link. This is the first step in the password recovery process, essential for the user to regain access to their account. After filling in the email, I clicked 'Send Reset Email' to submit the request. This action is crucial as it triggers the system to generate and send a confirmation email, which aligns with the user story of recovering their password quickly and easily.

**Action:** fill(143, 'user@example.com') # Fill in the email textbox with a sample email address
click(145) # Click on the 'Send Reset Email' button to initiate the password recovery process.

**Change Description:** After filling in the email and clicking the 'Send Reset Email' button, the browser state updated to display a confirmation message indicating that an email has been sent to 'user@example.com' for password reset, and the email textbox now shows the filled value 'user@example.com', while the button's position is slightly adjusted.
