# Task

**Exploring Websites**

As a curious user,
I navigate to various websites and explore their elements,
so that I can learn more about different resources available on the internet.

**Success definition:** Given I am on the browser and starting from an empty state
When I attempt to navigate to 'httpswww.example.com' and it fails, then successfully navigate to 'httpswww.wikipedia.org'
Then I should see the Wikipedia homepage displayed, allowing me to explore its content.

## Trajectory

**Step 1:**

**Url (before/after):** 

about:blank

about:blank

**Content (before/after):** 

```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```


```
RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** I initiated navigation to 'https://www.example.com' because it is the first step in fulfilling the user's goal of exploring various websites. This action represents an attempt to access a web resource that may contain information or elements of interest, thus contributing to the user's learning objective.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Navigate to a sample website to explore its elements.

**Change Description:** The browser attempted to navigate to 'https://www.example.com', but remained at 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation did not successfully occur.

**Reasoning for action:** I took this action to fulfill the user's intent of exploring various websites, starting with 'https://www.example.com'. By trying to navigate to this site first, I am adhering to the user story, which emphasizes exploration and learning from different online resources. If this navigation fails, I can then move on to the next specified website, ensuring that I progress towards achieving the user's goal of discovering content.

**Action:** goto('https://www.example.com') # Attempt to navigate to a sample website to explore its elements.

**Change Description:** The browser attempted to navigate to 'https://www.example.com', but the URL remained unchanged as 'about:blank', indicating that the navigation was unsuccessful.

**Content (before/after):**

RootWebArea, focused, url='about:blank'
```
**Reasoning for action:** The previous attempt to navigate to 'https://www.example.com' failed, which means I need to find an alternative resource for exploration. By choosing to navigate to 'https://www.wikipedia.org', I directly access a platform rich in information, as it is a well-known encyclopedia that houses a vast range of topics. This action aligns with the user story of exploring various resources and progresses towards displaying the Wikipedia homepage, enabling me to learn more by interacting with its content.

**Action:** goto('https://www.wikipedia.org') # Navigate to Wikipedia to explore its elements.

**Change Description:** The browser's URL has been changed to 'https://www.wikipedia.org', indicating navigation to the Wikipedia homepage; however, the focus remains on the RootWebArea without updating the accessibility tree representation.
